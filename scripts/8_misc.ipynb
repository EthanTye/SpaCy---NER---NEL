Why he admit about it and that about it. No further action. Then why RK admit lying and was send to committee.',\n 'I think most PAP leaders are like Singaporeans. We just want things to work. As for MPs who adopt LHL’s line of thinking… I really hope they retire sooner than later',\n 'Come come WP simps let me continue breaking down your little fantasy bubble for your since so many ppl are saying \"Oh its just a small issue lets get it over\";\"ohh VB lied about TT\"; \"Oh PAP is making this political there is no evidence u cant trust a liar RS\" First off, lying in parliament is not a small issue, especially when the allegations as about PS instructing RS to keep lying. Assuming he didn\\'t, all that is going to happen is a few months more for PS to prove himself before this entire saga ends. Assuming he DID instruct RS to lie, do you know what this proves? This means that your dear leader of the opposition has violated the integrity and trust people had in him. What happened if he was in position of power? Not only would he have lied, he would shown that he is someone that is willing to twist the truth to make things easier and seem better for him. Secondly, even with the police, or in the civil court, when one is accused of something, he has to prove himself innocent, whereas the prosecutor will try to prove him guilty. Yall seem very scared that they might be able to actually find something. If he is not guilty, then they would not be able to find evidence to convict him. PS indeed has the charm a leader should have, but if they can prove that he instructed RS to lie, then how? Lastly, VB did not lie. He giving the information he ASSUMED to be true. Additionally, if he did lie, why would they come out and say \"oh, we screwed up, we did indeed use TT data for a police case sorry\". Assuming he did lie, he has now spoken the truth without as many prompts as compared to RS. he also did not accuse anyone else of instructing him to lie. Additonally here is a little analogy for you. Ah Beng, Ah Seng, and Ah Heng are 3 friends. One day, Ah Beng finds out Ah Seng has been stealing from him. Ah Seng then says \"OH AH HENG TOLD ME TO DO SO\". There is no reason to believe nor disbelieve that Ah Seng was telling the truth. Then how? You have to investigate. Of course, if PAP cant prove that they find the truth and still convicts PS, then they are no longer holding the moral high ground.',\n 'Jamus for Leader of Opposition!',\n \"Using TT data is a multi-ministry effort that requires dozens of people who have to approve, ask supervisor to approve, ask boss to approve. I'm sure not just VB knew, but also the one in charge of MHA knew, but he's been protected from the spotlight.\",\n \"He sat on the info for months instead of clarifying. And given that the TT info was used by the police before his statement, MHA should have corrected him on the spot but didn't. They only came clean because citizens were requesting further confirmation about TT. If none of the ministers involved lied about TT, it means they are so incompetent that they did not know a precedent was set for police using TT data (something that should have gotten their approval). Either way, it is a sign that they are not fit for their job, be it due to dishonesty or incompetence.\",\n 'PM Lee\\'s  on this has parts worth watching/reading: > Some ask: \\'Wasn’t Ms Raeesah Khan the one who lied? Why are the Workers\\' Party leaders being treated more harshly?\\' > As the Leader of the House noted just now, if the Committee is right, then Mr Singh and his fellow Worker\\'s Party leaders themselves lied and presented untruths to the Committee. They lied under oath to protect themselves, to cover up their role, and to push the blame solely on to Ms Khan, claiming that she and other witness like Ms Loh had lied to the committee. > This is indeed more serious than what Ms Khan did, if it is so. > By lying under oath, they sought to frustrate the Committee process. They displayed the same kind of misconduct that the Committee was set up to address. They betrayed the trust reposed in them as MPs – and not least Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition. This, I hope members appreciate, if true, is a very grave matter\" > So, members must decide what Parliament will now do about this. Can we pretend nothing happened? Or if that\\'s too much to stomach, given the strong evidence laid out by the Committee, perhaps we lower our standards a little: note that untruths were told, but argue that it was after all not so serious a lie, and no harm was done. > If we do either of these things, we too would become complicit in dishonouring and demeaning Parliament. We must take the transgression seriously and act on it. And I\\'m glad that\\'s a conclusion the Committee has come to and recommended to the house. > What alternative choices did the Committee have? It could have recommended to Parliament to administer a token slap on the wrist. But that would show that we were taking a very serious matter rather lightly. Worse, by lowering our norms, we would be telling Singaporeans that it\\'s really not so bad for elected leaders to lie. > Alternatively, the Committee could have recommended that Parliament itself metes out an appropriately heavy penalty. This is something that Parliament has the power to do, but had the Committee recommended that, and Parliament decided on the penalty itself, the opposition would surely have cried foul and accused the PAP of using its majority to persecute the opposition. In fact they\\'re already insinuating this as a smoke screen to obscure the real issue: that the Worker\\'s Party had lied while under solemn oath. > I believe therefore that what the Committee recommends is the best way forward. Since a criminal offence appears to have been committed, let Parliament refer the matter to the public prosecutor. Let the public prosecutor consider the evidence afresh. Let the system work. If charges are filed, Mr Pritam Singh, and also Mr Faisal Manap, can defend themselves in court. The court will have to be satisfied that their guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt, and if they are innocent, they have nothing to fear. and from here PM Lee goes on and gets a bit more political',\n 'Then he should have hand over to HSK over in 2020, good 10 year tenure 60-70yo.

But it\\'s completely deluded to think that this whole fiasco was a result of PAP bullying, simply put the WP dug its own grave and if anything I would say the PAP have been rather muted on this as a political issue compared to in the past where it would definitely use a party member\\'s doings to attack the party (Remember the personal attacks on CSJ\\'s integrity in GE2015, the ridiculous harrassment of Sylvia by Grace Fu to apologise for her test balloon remark.

Changing his evidence and providing mutually contradictory accounts on whether he told RK to speak the truth regardless of whether the issue was brought up on the 4th Oct Parliamentary sitting. If both accounts cannot be true at the same time, the conclusion is that a falsehood was uttered at least once on this score 2. Loh and Nathan who testified that on their meeting on 12 Oct, Pritam gave them the impression that he had left the decision to tell the truth to RK and that there would be \\'no judgement\\'. This contradicts PS\\' claim that he made it \\'very clear\\' to RK to tell the truth if it was brought up on the 4th Oct sitting 3. Sylvia\\'s handwritten note that PS told RK on 3rd Oct that it was \\'her call\\' Like most people I did not have time to read the entire report so there might be more. I also do not have the brains to accurately ascertain PS\\' performance (for example when he went \"no no no Mr Tong you are a good lawyer\" I thought he looked pretty good but my small brain did not realise the significance of him changing evidence as I\\'ve stated above) The best outcome IMO is for the case to go to court, so that PS can clear his name',\n 'convening a COP and holding a witchtrial trying to find the entire leadership of a party guilty by association is muted? lol pap has always attempted to smear the character of their political opponents. look no further than the stuff they said about Yaw. palmer happened a while later and you ahould see LTK’s comments, a true gentleman. he said the party ahould handle it and he will not comment as he was no part of pap. and just smiled. https://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120216-328217.html back then during yaw saga, see how pap handled it, asking WP to answer, no different ten years later when they asking WP to answer for Raeesah. they have always been consistent in doing their best in casting their opposition in a bad light. muted you say?',\n \"may I know how exactly Pritam lied though? didn't he say that he gave Raeesah the choice, which is corroborated by the message provided by Sylvia, which of course directly contradicts Raeesah's statement that she was told to take it to the grave, which is no surprise since she is a liar. this is only thing I don't understand at all from a person who doesn't really have the time to read a 1000 page report on something that barely concerns me\",\n 'But it’s fine, a lot swing voters are on PAP’s side now, online trolls comments and keyboard warriors has always been opposition’s strong suit, as seen in past elections, there’s always been overwhelming of keyboard warriors bashing PAP brainlessly and amazing turnout during rallies, but the reality is that PAP still always win the election. Personally, I work in and with many professional lines, lawyers, accountants, engineers etc, 95% of the professionals I’ve met can’t be bothered with online chatters nor rallies, it’s plain obvious to them who to vote for. The other 5% vote for oppositions solely for the sake of creating competition for PAP to improve, never once they actually think that the oppositions are competent. One thing we all know for sure is that a common trait that all these online WP no brainers share are they expect everything to be free, no taxes, no raising cost, no inflation, free hand outs, free healthcare, free education, lagi best no GST nor income tax, basically governments should get their money from the tree to feed everyone. This already show you how uneducated this bunch are. 🤣',\n 'This is so stupid man.Vivian lied, realised they got caught lying, kept quiet and spent months with his team preparing a strategy to ensure the fallout was contained. And they have control of the country. The consequences for them will be far lesser then any opposition. The last thing i want from WP is for them to play politics and keep quiet also. The naivety is damming, our history is full of lessons of opposition being sued and jailed, Even those who were acquited were fucked afterwards. Its absolutely stupid to think they will be treated like the PAP.',\n \"Why didn't WP raise a point of contention to the Speaker of the House regarding VB's lie about TT? What you are talking about is absolutely true. Just like RK shouldn't lie in parliament, neither should VB. The people voted in WP to be a co-driver, on LTK's words, to wake up the driver when they fall asleep. VB himself THANKED WP for not making more of the issue. If you believe in having a strong opposition to keep the PAP honest, and I 100% believe that a strong opposition SHOULD have the responsibility to keep the PAP honest, then why didn't the WP do more to have VB censured regarding his words? If the WP's role is just to have a presence and not rock the boat, then what is the purpose of an opposition? Might as well just have more PAP in parliament. Keeping quiet over the TT issue, and then obviously trying to sweep the RK issue under the carpet shows that PS only wanted to keep the WP in position and not lose political points, while doing nothing to better the voice of the people in parliament.\",\n 'Because it wasn’t a lie? It’s only a lie if you realize at the time that you are telling an untruth. Vivian made an inaccurate statement without intending to. There’s a difference.

But there's no record of him asking her if she sorted it out yet. It seems to me like he just kept quiet and didn't press her to tell the truth. I don't think he told her to take it to the grave like she claimed, but at the same time I think he just tried to let it die down. Coupled with the fact that WP only created their own committee to investigate her after she came clean/was exposed\",\n 'And what is the intention of cop?

They asked about it in Parliament officially, including why it took several months for VB to inform the public. The answer of why didn't WP do more is in Singapore by design, the opposition has no power. Consider the structure of the government. The legislature is unimaceral, meaning there's only one house and the simple majority passes and revokes all laws. The executive, the PM is chosen also by the ruling party. The executive controls the PSC and its chairman, who stands on the committee that selects potential presidential candidates based on legislation. And historically walkovers are frequent, and the president is a rubber stamp who is usually also a member of the ruling party and does what they say. The president in turns elect the Supreme Court Justice, who is the highest court authority. The ministers control the police as part of the executive. And because of recent legislature non MHA ministers can also order investigations. Every facet of the government is controlled by the ruling party. Parliament is like Hong Lim Park, supposedly it let's a mechanism for democracy but its really just a show. Nothing will change until power is split.\",\n \"Probably because Incompetence =/= lying And if you are asking why WP never raise any contention about VB's incompetence, because incompetence\",\n '>My work since i graduate require me to focus on only one of the Act and even people in my industry wont be able to say that act accurately offhand.

Your paragraph above on how TT adoption was lagging reinforces that. And pretty sure bills are already well discussed behind closed doors before they are tabled. Especially for our rubber stamp parliamentary system. Ie. It was already discussed way before Jan 8. VB claims ground work was already done back in Nov, after he realize his mistake in end Oct.

But the entire positioning of PAP thusfar has been that they\\'re guilty already. So clearly they don\\'t actually care what the WP did whether big or small, they just want to find something to whack them with. Its dirty politics. It has nothing to do with what actually is important in politics and everything to do with \"fixing\" the opposition. Do u really think the COP sounded like an investigation or an interrogation?',\n 'so did PAP minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan sit on the info for months or did he come clean immediately. Surely you can answer this question?',\n \">Why would she need to dicuss and explain the circumstance if they agreed with her? Can you explain this part. I don't quite understand The COP recommendation are based on Pritam's inconsistent testimony, lack of paper evidence showing that he told her to own up (no WhatsApp or email, nothing), Sylvia's testimony and the testimony of the 2 assistant's who talked to PS in their meeting. They are not largely based on RK testimony I'll just treat RK as a liar. I don't believe that PS told her to take the lie to the grave either\",\n 'You\\'ve mentioned on issue, so I don\\'t agree \"most of the irreconcilable facts\". Also by definition, any fact that is irreconcilable would weigh against them because that\\'s what you\\'re trying to reconcile against. Yeah I definitely disagree. I actually bothered to watch a lot of the COP and honestly I would also be super frustrated if I was PS. Edwin Tong was not really being fair and pretty antagonistic. PS was being \"lawyered\" and so as a lawyer he hit back. Desmond Lee was far less antagonistic and we can see that those sessions where much more amicable.',\n \"1) So let's imagine a meeting between PS and RK, where she admitted he asked her to go to the COP, so that's one time asking her to tell the truth, which is based on RK's statement, >But after discussions and me explaining the circumstances that led me to the information in the first place, that changed. if they agreed with her, why was there a need for a discussion? and if the discussion was positive, there was no need to explain the circumstances. which obviously points at resistance from WP leadership against her not coming clean. so this points at repeated attempts asking her to tell the truth. and at that point of time, based on her state of mind, from recounting her painful experiences, they may have choose not to push her further and told her she should decide on her next step and they will not judge her. And why would it not be possible for her to deem her next step to be to take it to the grave and take what WP told her as tacit approval of that step. It means both were not lying, just RK made assumptions that WP by not pushing her tacitly agreed with her taking it to the grave. This is definitely not far-fetched considering RK at times seemed to be living in her own world, and showed signs of cognitive dissonance and doing things without a care for consequences. for eg. when told to substantiate, ignored it (PS asked her to do so before she made the speech), or saying she sometimes dont know what she is doing. (she admitted to WP leadership) 2) Pritam's testimony was very consistent, he insisted from the very start he asked her to come clean repeatedly. I don't think it can be misconstrued as him being inconsistent in any way. It clearly points to the inconsistency between PS's statement and that of RK, which I have given a reasonable reenactment in point 1. I would largely discount the testimonies of her aides as they were basically giving 2nd hand accounts of what RK told them, so in actual fact they are an extension of what RK said, or what one would call tiagong from RK. when the aides claimed PS said he will not judge her and it is her call. it is her call to come clean or her call to decide when to come clean, this is all up for interpretation. regarding SL's testimony, it is consistent with PS, and seems like the COP is cherrypicking certain soundbites to paint PS in a bad light.\",\n 'a) so his party knew but didnt do anything about it. isn’t that the same thing PS is being accused off? lol, shouldnt a COP be held to investigate VB and everyone who knew but kept mum by not publicly coming clean the moment they knew? regardless who brought it up, and am 100% sure it wasnt VB. they had ample opportunity to come clean for more than two months but they didnt. so why is the COP expecting PS to come clean immediately when PAP dont even practice that?',\n \"> a) so his party knew but didnt do anything about it. isn’t that the same thing PS is being accused off? lol, shouldnt a COP be held to investigate VB and everyone who knew but kept mum by not publicly coming clean the moment they knew? a) the party knew and did not try to hide it or give a false impression of their knowledge of events or give very vague, arguably improper, instructions on what to do. no one is saying PS should have come clean immediately after RK told him in Aug; if she owned up on Oct it would have been fine. and b) which party was it that brought up TT? you know you don't need to structure your answer as a list if there's only one item right?\",\n '>  Fully vaccinated status of about 1,000 people who took non-mRNA jabs expected to have expired by deadline > SINGAPORE: Among those who completed their primary course of COVID-19 vaccination with non-mRNA vaccines, about 1,000 had not taken their booster jab as of Feb 9 and would have had their fully vaccinated status expire by Feb 14. > Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary gave these figures in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 15), in response to questions by MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang). > It was previously announced that from Feb 14, those aged 18 and above will have to take a booster shot within 270 days of completing their primary vaccination series in order to maintain their fully vaccinated status. > For people who received the Sinovac vaccine as part of a three-dose primary vaccination series, they should receive an mRNA vaccine as their booster dose, the Health Ministry stated. > Those who are medically ineligible to receive the mRNA vaccine can get the Sinovac shot as their booster dose under the national vaccination programme, Dr Puthucheary said. > This is only for people aged 18 and above, he added, as the vaccine manufacturer did not include children and adolescents when filing for interim authorisation of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). > \"Both Sinovac-CoronaVac and the Sinopharm vaccines are also not currently recommended for routine use in persons aged below 18 years of age by the World Health Organization,\" Dr Puthucheary added. --- 1.0.2      ',\n 'the truth is public service is so messed up.

Mr Oh\\'s daughter, Seng Li, said she and her 50-year-old mother, Madam Tacih, \"really didn\\'t know about this\" until they read about it a few weeks ago. \"I was shocked and cried (when I found out),\" said the teenager. \"I made sure (when I spoke to him) on the phone that he was living properly there.\" The Batam media had picked up reports here, including from The Straits Times, about how Mr Oh had been living in the Sungei Tengah forested area in Singapore for more than 30 years. The 79-year-old slept in a makeshift tent and grew vegetables, which he was caught selling without a permit in Teck Whye Lane last Christmas Day. The incident was captured by a passer-by on video and uploaded on Facebook, where it went viral. Bukit Panjang MP Liang Eng Hwa and his grassroots volunteers stepped in to help. While Mr Oh stayed in Bangkit Road with his late brother\\'s daughter-in-law, who was also in the dark about his living conditions earlier, they helped him to secure a more permanent roof over his head. Responding to queries from ST via phone messages earlier in the week, Seng Li said her father had always assured them that everything was fine when asked how he was doing in Singapore. She also clarified she is only 17 years old and not a medical student as her father had told the press. She is still studying in a high school and explained that her father does not really know what \"high school\" is. Her parents met in Batam, though her mother worked as a housemaid in Singapore \"decades ago\", she added. While her father is Singaporean, her mother is Indonesian. They have been living apart all these years as Mr Oh had to work here and could not afford to relocate them to Singapore. He sends them about $500 monthly, drawn from his savings from his past work as a labourer. Seng Li is an only child, but her mother has adopted a seven-year-old boy, who is actually the son of her mother\\'s brother. They live in a small house with two rooms. Mr Oh had been living in the Sungei Tengah forested area in Singapore for over 30 years. ST PHOTO: DESMOND WEE The teenager also shared with ST some photos of her family when she was younger, explaining that more recent family photos were lost together with her mobile phone. She has not seen her father for two years since the Covid-19 pandemic started. He used to visit them over the weekend once every two weeks before the pandemic began. They now keep in touch with brief daily phone calls at about 7.30pm. Seng Li has never been to Singapore but hopes to do so soon. \"I want to visit him soon. But mum and I don\\'t know if it\\'s okay to go to Singapore. Now it\\'s Covid-19,\" she said. She also does not have a passport, while her mother\\'s has expired. When contacted, Mr Liang said: \"We would like to help Mr Oh meet his family in Batam and are currently checking if he can do so under the newly launched Indonesia VTL (vaccinated travel lane) arrangements.\" Mr Oh, who works as a gardener at a horticulture company, which pays him about $1,200 monthly, moved into a one-room rental flat in Chua Chu Kang on Feb 1, the first day of Chinese New Year. His new housemate is still waiting for an auspicious date to join him. When ST visited Mr Oh on Friday night (Feb 11), he said he was getting used to his new home, and complained that the water from the tap was \"too cold\" compared with the pond water in the forest. However, a water heater, small refrigerator and TV set will arrive in the next few days, all donated by well-wishers, including ST readers who were moved by his story. Mr Liang\\'s grassroots volunteers also donated some essential items, such as a bed, bedsheets, a pillow, a table, an induction cooker, a rice cooker and some groceries. What he needs is more storage space as the only table is filled with cooking utensils, leaving him with little space to eat. He does not have a wardrobe either. Some old habits die hard. He still sleeps at 8pm and wakes up at 3am every day. His meals are still porridge with vegetables, including his packed lunch at work. He visits his vegetable garden in the forest occasionally to make sure his chilli padi and other greens are growing well, and to bring some back for his meals. On Sunday, he indulged a little and bought a mackerel from the market for $8. He fried it, kept it in a cardboard box on the basin to prevent flies, and ate it over five days. \"My biggest wish now is that my family can live with me in Singapore one day,\" he said in Hokkien.

They nevertheless maintained their GoodGuy image. There\\'s noway the PAP are going to let them get away with it',\n \">Personally, I find it really shocking that the COP's recommendations is based mainly on RK's claim that PS told her to continue to lie. No. If you read the report, the COP sets out the reasons why they do not believe PS’s version of events. It is not as if the COP simply said “RK said that PS told her to lie and we believe her”, the COP also goes through PS’s evidence and finds lots of inconsistencies and holes. pg 92 Para 54 - pg 95 para 61 Mr Singh did not tell Ms Khan to proactively clarify the truth on 4 Oct 2021 Mr Singh admits that he did not tell Ms Khan to proactively raise the matter, and clarify the truth on 4 Oct. Mr Singh changed his evidence, when his earlier evidence became untenable While Mr Singh agreed eventually that this was his position (i.e. that he did not tell Ms Khan to proactively clarify the truth on 4 Oct), he had first tried alternate answers. Mr Singh’s change of evidence went as follows: (See paragraph 55 of the Report) (1) At first, he said that Ms Khan had to clarify the truth, proactively, on 4 Oct, even if the issue did not come up. He said that it was “very clear” that this was what Ms Khan was meant to do. (2) It was pointed out to him, by the Committee, that no preparations had been made for Ms Khan to tell the truth (see paragraph 52 of the Report for the preparations that would be needed.) He had said that no preparatory steps had been taken, because it was uncertain if Ms Khan would have to clarify the truth. (3) It was clear at that point, that Mr Singh’s evidence (that Ms Khan would have to come clean, proactively) was not tenable. Mr Singh then changed his position, and admitted that he did not tell Ms Khan to come clean (proactively), on 4 Oct. The above relates to facts; what happened, what did not happen. Mr Singh should have had no difficulties in giving straight answers. But he made up his answers as he went along, answers which he thought were necessary, to save himself, without much regard to the truth (see paragraph 61 below.) The above is one example. The eventual position Mr Singh took was that Ms Khan did not have to clarify the truth if the matter was not raised. The explanation Mr Singh settled on runs into the following difficulties: (1) Ms Khan was to tell the truth only if the matter gets raised in Parliament. (2) The obvious question is: why only if the matter gets raised? Wasn’t it important to have the truth clarified anyway? Mr Singh had himself said it was important for Ms Khan to clarify the truth.64 (He had also said that if a WP MP told a lie, the “minimum” expected was that the MP would have to correct it, and come forward with the truth.) He went to see Ms Khan, specifically to advise her on what she should say. The only thing that Mr Singh should have said to Ms Khan was that she should tell the truth on 4 Oct, regardless of whether the matter was raised in Parliament – if Mr Singh’s intention was that the truth be told. It is telling that he did not say that to Ms Khan. It is also telling that when he was giving evidence, he realised that this was a weakness, and at first tried to say that he had told Ms Khan to tell the truth, regardless of whether the matter was raised. And then he had to backtrack and change his story. Mr Singh’s admission, that he did not tell Ms Khan to clarify the truth, proactively, is consistent with Ms Khan’s evidence, that on 8 Aug, he had told Ms Khan to take the Untruth to the grave, and that on 3 Oct, he essentially repeated that advice. Mr Singh’s explanation for admitting that he did not tell Ms Khan to proactively clarify the truth, on 4 Oct, is also not credible. He said that this was because he was prepared to give Ms Khan time to come to him and say, “Look, Pritam, I’ve spoken to my parents and I’m going to come clean”. (As at 3 Oct, Mr Singh did not know whether Ms Khan had spoken to her parents.) That answer makes no sense. If he did not know whether Ms Khan had spoken with her parents, and if it was important (as Mr Singh said it was), – he would have asked Ms Khan. But he did not ask this simple question. If it was an “immediate concern” that she tell her parents, as Mr Singh said it was, then why did Mr Singh expect (as he claims he did), that Ms Khan should tell the truth, if the matter was raised on 4 Oct? It would be more logical that he would then have said to her: “The matter might come up tomorrow. You will have to tell the truth. Have you told your parents?” He did not do that. On 3 Oct, when he met her, her parents were around in the premises, though they were not part of the conversation. Mr Singh’s explanations show that other parts of his evidence are also untrue Mr Singh’s explanations also show that he was not being truthful when he said that he had wanted Ms Khan to tell the truth if the matter gets raised on 4 Oct (1) This is so because, on his own evidence, Ms Khan telling her parents was a “condition precedent” to clarifying the truth publicly. Yet, Mr Singh says that he did not know if Ms Khan had told her parents, and he didn’t ask. (2) Thus, in his mind, the key precondition to telling the truth had not been met. (3) Since the pre-condition had not been met, based on his own evidence, he could not have asked (or expected), Ms Khan to tell the truth on 4 Oct, even if the matter was raised. (4) That means only one thing: he advised her to repeat the Untruth on 4 Oct, if the matter was raised, and fully expected that she will follow his advice.\",\n \"The UK Erskine May has already laid it: Ministers and MPs that inadvertently mislead the house are not subject to contempt.

One of which, to no surprise, will be the long-planned Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase that the authorities have described as critical for bringing in the additional revenue that Singapore needs for an ageing population. > “The past two years of pandemic has taken a huge toll on Singapore’s fiscal resources, and there is now an urgent need to refocus on fiscal sustainability,” DBS senior economist Irvin Seah said. > KPMG Singapore’s tax partner See Wei Hua noted that Budget 2022 will be “one of the more tax-focused budgets in recent years”. > “(People are watching) for any changes to the tax regime, especially given that the Government has tapped more than S$50 billion of the reserves over the last two years,” he said. > “Now that we are emerging from COVID-19, the question is how can the Government make sure that its fiscal condition will be sustainable over the longer period?” > RISING EXPENDITURE > Singapore is not alone. > Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Indonesia, have also started mulling tax hikes. As the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out in a report last year, the pandemic “has caused a significant deterioration in public finances, which calls for a rethink of tax and spending policies once the recovery is well underway\". > The fight against the pandemic over the last two years has seen Singapore accumulating budget deficits of S$75 billion, while drawing the equivalent of about 20 years of fiscal surpluses from past reserves. > Prior to COVID-19, public expenditure was already on the rise with the Government’s revenue struggling to keep up. > Over a 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019, yearly expenditure on government administration, economic development and social development rose by an average of 9.1 per cent, 7.7 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively, according to a report from UOB. > On the other hand, operating revenue – derived largely from taxes – grew at a slower rate of 6.6 per cent per year over the same period. According to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), tax collections accounted for 73.6 per cent of the Government’s total revenue in FY2020. > As a result, the Government’s primary balance, defined as operating revenue minus total expenditure, has been negative in five out of the past six fiscal years, noted UOB economist Barnabas Gan. > “This suggests that tax receipts including that of personal income, corporate and GST have not been enough to cover the rising expenditure costs,” he said. > The “only way” to close this deficit in the primary balance has been to tap on the net investment returns contribution, noted Barclays economist Brian Tan. “This is not sustainable. You’ll ideally want that to be a bonus that you can do without, instead of something you’re absolutely dependent on for fiscal sustainability.” > Moving forward, the Government’s spending will only go up in the face of challenges such as a rapidly ageing population and climate change. > For instance, Singapore’s healthcare spending has tripled in dollar terms over the past decade, now standing at 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). This expenditure is expected to hit 3 per cent of GDP by 2030, and will “keep rising” even beyond that, authorities have said. > Such longer-term needs will incur “significant costs” and require a sustainable source of revenue, said Mr Seah. > “Unfortunately, there aren’t many options available when it comes to reliable sources of tax revenue,” he added, noting that there is “limited” room to tweak corporate and personal income tax rates without diluting the country’s overall competitiveness. --- 1.0.2      ',\n 'Defending Raesshah Khan now is more like fuck WP than PAP',\n \"Bertha addressed this point in her commentary as well (which I thought was an excellent and balanced summary): > It’s clear to me that from Aug 8 onwards, the WP was hoping that the issue would simply go away.[...] the WP would be tempted to tell itself that keeping quiet was the best thing for everyone, especially Ms Khan and her family. After all, five days have already passed. Hence, the absence of any discourse on the subject among them or preparations for a clarification in Parliament. >If there was a conspiracy, it was to keep silent. So, they moved on to other things even on that day, like how to respond to disquiet over Ms Khan’s speech on female genital cutting and polygamy. So the most likely scenario is that Pritam was trying to sweep things under the rug, and hoped that RK wouldn't need to admit to the lie if the issue wasn't brought up again (despite claiming otherwise during the COP). Unfortunately for him, he forgot that Shan is not someone who would have given up so easily.\",\n 'The perjury part is because Pritam repeatedly stated that he had put it very clearly to RK that she was expected to tell the truth at the next available opportunity. Yet there was no process involving her drafting responses, a process which was used in both her response to the Muslim FGC issue and also her eventual clarification in November. This process was not started in any form between Aug and Nov. If they had expected her to make the clarification, then there should have at least been requests of drafts etc. None were found. Then Pritam said that he felt she needed to tell her parents first, because sexual assault is a serious matter. This was in his words a pre-condition which would need to be satisfied. However his own testimony is that he never asked whether she had told her parents. If you feel that A must happen before B can happen, and you testify that you expect B to happen, then logically you would ask about whether A has happened. But his own testimony is that he never asked about A. When he (with evidence) told RK that they absolutely have to make a clarification in Nov, he also didn\\'t ask about whether she had already to her parents. Their actions made no logical sense according to Faisal himself, if they were expecting that she would come clean about her statements either in Sep or Oct. The WP\\'s own testimony is that RK\\'s bout of shingles did not preclude her from having prepared drafts etc for a clarification in Sep or Oct. The keypoint here is that if the WP had said that \"sexual assault is very serious and we wanted to give her space to come to a decision by herself\" then they would be in less trouble. But they kept testifying that \"we were very clear that she had to come clean and that she was not to lie anymore\" even though they made no actions/preparations for her to come clean.',\n \">he forgot that Shan is not someone who would have given up so easily One wonders if RK's Family had put on any pressure on WP to keep things under wrapped that might had affected his decision making.\",\n 'Upvote for you.

I can understand why but his reasons is really CMI la. Read below \\\\+++ WHY DID DENNIS TAN OBJECT TO THE REPORT The COP report has dissected, and completely eviscerated Workers Party's position in these proceedings. It is devastating; leaving no doubt that Mr Singh told Ms Khan to bury the lie and then lied to the COP. He also lied to his own party, suppressed information about his own complicity from his own CEC, his own members, his own cadres, and accused Ms Khan of being a mental case. For good measure, he also attacked his long serving cadre members and called them liars. This is about the worst behaviour one has seen in Singapore's Parliamentary history. But perhaps the most devastating comment about the Workers Party is not coming from the COP in its multi-page report. Buried somewhere in the reams of paper attached to the report are the Minutes of the Committee's deliberation on 7 February. Mr Dennis Tan, not surprisingly, voted against the recommendations of the Report (even though there was unanimous consent on the factual parts of the Report). Mr Tan was asked to explain his objections, and the Committee discussed it fully. Paragraph 10 of the Minutes is particularly interesting. When asked to explain why Mr Tan felt that Mr Singh’s instruction to lie would not amount to mitigation for Ms Khan, Mr Tan said “There should be no consideration of the Party leaders role in telling Ms Khan to lie, as mitigation”. He goes on further and says that in fact, even if Mr Singh, Ms Lim and/or Mr Faisal had told Ms Khan to lie, the onus should still have been on Ms Khan to disobey them, disagree and then insist on coming clean in Parliament, against their instructions. I can understand Mr Tan’s reluctance to agree to a Report which damns his own Party leaders (well-reasoned as it was). But it is quite something else to object to the Report on the basis that even if Ms Khan was told to lie by Mr Singh, that would be alright. And that in fact Ms Khan, with a year’s experience in Parliament, as an MP, should stand up against her Secretary General and disobey him. That is not only a completely untenable position, it also gives us a window into the Workers Party's own position and philosophy on integrity. What kind of mindset does the Party leadership have when Mr Tan (as a senior politician and a CEC member) can say that it doesn't matter that Ms Khan was told by her leaders to lie. She can be told to lie by her Party leaders, but it should be her own responsibility to defy and come clean? What does it say about the mindset of the Party leadership? What openness, transparency, integrity and accountability are we talking about? As far as the Workers Party is concerned, it is just talk.

But while the mainstream media will be undoubtedly plastered with headlines of all the malicious lying and deliberate covering up, I also feel it is important to recognise the evidences submitted in their entirety and scroll through some of the WhatsApp texts between RK and Pritam that were presented in the COP’s annex. Focusing on the genesis of RK’s lies, and Pritam’s initial response, I think it should be pretty clear that RK wanted the problem to go away, while Pritam wanted to take this issue head on and resolve it. I wish Pritam followed through on his initial desire for RK to tell nothing but the absolute truth, but I also wonder how simple telling that truth was, given that RK flip-flopped on her lies more than once and changed her story numerous times, even when giving formal clarifications. To what remit should Pritam or the WP leaders had done to press RK for confidential information in order to determine the truth of her lies? And once the lies started, how practical was it to start backtracking when untrue clarifications have already been made and the lies have snowballed in parliament without many options than to double down? In hindsight, I think it is extremely easy to say that WP should have exposed RK at all costs, but I also do not think me or many of us would have done differently. This is not to absolve Pritam or the WP leaders of any responsibility, but to recognise the constraints of dealing with what they were dealt on their plate, against an unrepentant MP who was only seeking to push her own agenda and was never truly seeking to tell the truth at any point before she was exposed. Were Pritam and WP leaders naive to trust and believe that RK would do the right thing? Definitely. Should Pritam and WP leaders be disciplined in one form or another for allowing the lies to fester? Yes. But should that punishment be the ultimate price of losing their parliament seat? I think that would be better served by asking the people to decide in the next election, as any maturing democracy should expect of its constituents, instead of it being decided in courts or parliament, as there would only be further illusions of the government trying to “fix the opposition”.',\n '>  COP report: Workers\\' Party says possible criminal charges for 2 leaders noted with \\'grave concern\\' > SINGAPORE: The Workers\\' Party (WP) said on Friday (Feb 11) that the recommendation by the Committee of Privileges (COP) to refer two of its leaders for possible public prosecution has been noted \"with grave concern\". > The COP on Thursday released its final report on the complaint made against former WP MP Raeesah Khan for lying in Parliament. > The Committee has recommended that Ms Khan be fined S$35,000 for telling a false anecdote in Parliament on Aug 3 and repeating it on Oct 4. > It also proposed that WP chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh, as well as party vice-chair Faisal Manap be referred to the public prosecutor for possible criminal charges. > \"The Workers’ Party notes these developments with grave concern.

We Singaporeans will laugh at the WP if they started trying to dog-hound everything said by every member of the PAP and causing a huge ruckus whenever they spoke inappropriately.

It feels like he was not very interested in handling RK issue, hoping things will just disappear. But when the public furore came in, it feels like he decided to throw RK under the bus to save his own ass. And it also feels like, since RK is going down, she wants to drag him/them down.

Come on, having the COP full of PAP MPs does not change the fact the PS was vicious at the max or gross negligence at the least.

It could mean just a warning, or a fine, or expulsion from parliament among many other things. I don’t think everybody will agree that what Pritam or what WP leaders have done is on serious equivalence to theft and fraud even if they are all illegal. Simply put, in the court of public opinion, would it be overkill to remove 2 opposition MPs over their conduct during a COP proceeding which many people already find unfair to begin with? So while it is technically and definitely possible for Pritam and Faisal to lose their seats over what they might or might not have done (because it is all alleged at this point), there is also a court of public opinion that is equally important when talking about politics and optics. Because politics isn’t just what things are, it is what people see things as.

For a honest mistake and a genuine confession, it’s easy to forgive. But for a serious character flaw in which one deliberately tries to invent more lies to cover up the first one, that’s definitely unforgivable. Essentially when Pritam found out in August that RK was lying, he only had 2 choice. Hope that the truth won’t ever be revealed, or go all out and admit that he had a rogue MP among his ranks who repeatedly defied him and lied to him. And that’s even considering Pritam actually stood up to defend RK in the last election, so if he went ahead to admit just that, the media headlines won’t be too kind on him either considering he is after all supposed to be the strong and smart LOTO. Pritam and WP were condemned to suffer no matter what they did. It wasn’t just because RK lied once, that would have been easily solved with an apology, it was because RK was repeatedly lying and going around her leader’s back defying what he said or tried to tell her to do, which cast the WP in a far worse light than just telling one simple lie.',\n \"Absolutely agree with this. PAP seems to be wilfully ignorant of the fact that a person's choice can have multiple motivations behind it. In this case, broadly speaking, two possible motivations: 1) Pritam wanted to give Raeesah the necessary space, as compassion would allow 2) Pritam was hoping to 'act blur live longer' Sure, I think most people in Pritam's position would hope against hope that the whole thing would just blow over without fuss. But there was also the fact that Raeesah was claiming to be a victim of all sorts of things, and in this circumstance, the most humane course of action would be to show compassion and allow her to do things at her own time. So, which motivation was in the driver's seat, so to speak? Given Pritam's previous conduct and track record, I reasonably believe it is 1) the former. But of course, it is in PAP's best interest to assume it is 2) the latter. In the end, I think the fault lies almost solely with Raeesah, again given her previous conduct and track record. And given PAP's previous conduct and track record, they are definitely playing dirty and trying to use this as an opportunity to take down their political opponents.

The ruling party doesn’t decide the punishment. The Court does. The COP can refer the matter to AGC, who can then decide whether to bring the matter to Court.

That’s the law under the Constitution which MPs from both the PAP and the WP are subject to. These are all events which would flow from the application of established law.

The Straits Times Index has rallied more than 9% so far in 2022, among the top-performing equity gauges globally. The Singapore dollar is up against most major currencies during the same time, gaining about 0.5% against the greenback. > In two Facebook posts this week, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong shared videos explaining the need for a GST hike. The additional revenue will go toward supporting “growing health care needs and enable us to better take care of our seniors,” he said in a post Wednesday. > Singapore’s health care expenditures have surged in recent years as the population ages, jumping to over S$18 billion ($13 billion) estimated for the current fiscal year, from less than S$4 billion in 2010, according to government data. > Economists at Maybank Investment Banking Group, formerly known as Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte., forecast that a 2 percentage point rise in GST will increase annual collections by S$3.6 billion, which would make it the second-largest contributor to the government’s operating revenue after corporate income tax. > Rising energy and food costs, which have pushed prices higher for things as varied as electricity and cakes, is complicating the drive for a tax hike. The fastest core inflation reading in seven years prompted a surprise tightening of monetary policy by the central bank last month, while Singapore’s recovery is set to slow after rebounding in 2021. > “A GST hike has an inflationary impact, but it is a one-off,” said David Sandison, head of tax at Grant Thornton Singapore Pte., an advisory firm. “It is better to bite the bullet now and get it over with, as the hike itself is an inevitability.” > A GST rise may also pose a political risk to the government, after the main opposition Workers’ Party won a record number of seats in the 2020 general election on a manifesto that included opposition to the tax increase. A move now could further cost the ruling People’s Action Party, Han Fook Kwang, a former editor of the Straits Times newspaper, said in an opinion piece last week. > So far, officials have rebuffed growing calls for a delay. Households will be insulated from the brunt of the GST hike by a S$6 billion package announced in the budget in 2021, the finance ministry said in a reply to a forum post last month in The Straits Times. And irrespective of when the tax is raised, the actual impact will be delayed for years, it added. > “I know many of you are concerned about the cost of living, and this is why we will have a comprehensive set of measures in place to cushion the impact of GST on lower-income and middle-income households, as well as retirees,” Wong said in Wednesday’s video, adding that the government will permanently enhance a GST voucher policy to assist lower-income families. > Other levies may also be announced in the upcoming budget, including an increase in carbon taxes and new wealth taxes. > (Updates with market and currency moves in fifth paragraph.) > —With assistance from Lianting Tu and Derek Wallbank. > © 2022 Bloomberg L.P. --- 1.0.2      ',\n 'Is the Straits Times a valid source?

Its like WP shat themselves with all their leaders contradicting each other and served it up to the PAP in a platter',\n \"You don't need to be a genius to figure out that PAP will use this opportunity to destroy WP.\",\n \"Keeping them around creates the illusion of an opposition. The PAP would much rather have them vs literally everyone else. The rest are combative many to the point of opposing for the sake of it. WP is there more or less to take up space. Do they have any real stance on most issues? Not really. No one even know whether they are pro-antivax or their opinion of how the govt is doing on covid, on the differential measures etc. Whatever statement they put out are mostly tokenism but when press on the issue they usually take 1 step back Whether you agree with PSP or not at least they have a consistent position on their anti Indian nationals and anti VDS stance. WP's credibility literally comes from no one having a clue what they're doing so the anti PAP and their supporters just credit them for anything that benefits them or something that makes PAP look bad like the TT incident how r/sg all pointed out the need for opposition when issue was actually brought up by PAP. There was another one last year where r/sg was crediting the WP for helping improve the progressive wage model scheme when they literally did nothing. The planned improvement had been in place for a while and PWM had been improved and reviewed annually The PAP couldn't ask for better opposition. Having LOTO lose his seat would be seen as PAP bullying and create a power vaccum for a potentially more aggressive party like PSP to take over. Neither is preferable for the next GE especially since there is the GST factor to consider\",\n 'WP is PAP-lite, they have mostly the same economic/social approach and policies. Some other party might actually present a strong challenge their position (even if it’s for the wrong reasons like PSP).',\n \"Agree. Removing the LOTO will actually be a politically damaging move. What I believe the PAP wants to do is to show the LOTO that they have control over him. Whether he stays or leaves is within PAP's hands. That way, they can maintain the public impression that parliament has some balance of voices, while controlling the LOTO and ensuring he stays in line. Make no mistake, PAP is politically shrewd 11/10. You may not like them but you can't deny they are smart.\",\n 'To their credit they had a stance on min wages no?

You cannot compare the LKY era with today. People are more accepting of a single party during his era Contrary to what r/sg thinks. PAP isn\\'t stupid and they know what they people better than r/sg Times have change. People want some sort of opposition. The PAP knows this, why did you think they expanded the NCMP roles and responsibility. Having an opposition will also help improve international image. PAP doesn\\'t want SG to be seen as a single party dictatorship The best way to achieve that is to have a corporative opposition like WP What PAP wants isn\\'t to eliminate WP. What they want is a discredited Opposition so while the opposition may always be around, they will not be a threat to them',\n \"1. I don't think those who lean towards the opposition are blind. That is a very sweeping statement that has shown your bias. It is not right to say that just because you support one party or the other mean you are blind. It just means you have a differing set of views. Granted there is some truth to your statement but such a sweeping statement is doing disservice to the informed opposition supporter. 2. LKY was a good leader. During his era, SG was in its formative stages and there was little room that could be afforded to the opposition especially if they hindered his vision of Singapore. Was he a perfect leader? Absolutely not. Am I grateful for his leadership, to an extent, yes. So it is not correct to compare such times. 3. The NCMP role was created because there was like 1 opposition voice in Parliament so to not show that SG was a dictatorship, they added these roles to give the opposition some semblance of power. So lets not go there. 4. People want an opposition because the current PAP leadership is out of touch with the ground. You see them close to once a year. They draw huge salaries and listen to very little feedback from the public. Just look at our potential PM candidates. None of them impress and you are left choosing the least terrible choice. It's not right to say that the calibre of PAP hasn't dropped as well. Just look at the slip ups in the PAP camp in recent times. I bet you no way would LKY have allowed such things to happen. In summary, what the PAP wants only the PAP knows. To me, if PS is indeed no longer an MP, it is a huge blow to the WP and the progress of all opposition. However, PS is not the be all end all of SG opposition, I hope that our leaders will just be better. Be it opposition or the PAP cause with better leadership, the citizens will benefit. I could care less which party they represented. At the moment, however, if you are of low or middle income, it will be harder to survive in SG. Edited: Grammar\",\n 'Add creation of the LOTO office and giving PS a payraise to that list. There was literally no reason for PAP to do so if they wanted a weak WP',\n 'RK literally is being charged for lying with Parliament and the two WP leaders are currently only being referred to for investigation by the prosecutor...what are you on about? RK isn\\'t \"getting off lightly\" with anything, for all we know the ultimate punishment for Pritam may be lighter than a 35K fine. You literally have no idea what you\\'re talking about. Why are you so against them being investigated? Don\\'t you want the truth to emerge? If Pritam is innocent, wouldn\\'t he want his name to be cleared with an investigation? It\\'s obvious that someone lied during the COP hearings. By the evidence, the COP did exactly what it is supposed to do due to the conflicting testimony from WP...how exactly are they acting in a biased way? If anything, it would be a shocking dereliction of duty not to call an investigation after such egregiously conflicting accounts from different WP members. It is beyond doubt someone was lying.',\n \"1. When your differing views are almost always wrong, you probably want to look in the mirror 2. LHL preceded over what is arguable SG most prosperous era with little to no opposition. So how is it suddenly not correct to have little to no opposition moving forward. Especially since the vast majority of democracy that has very strong opposition are countries none of you opposition would want to live in. Contrary to the fake image of democracy that r/sg has, most real democracies are poor nations which most of you won't even want to live in. Barring a few nations in Western and northern Europe, vast majority of democracy have far lower standards of living than SG. So why is there any justification for any opposition especially since you guys keep claiming LKY era was the greatest in SG history, literally an era with 0 opposition. I'm not saying having opposition is bad, I think having good opposition is good. Keyword being good ones not the current incompetent ones we have right now 3. The NCMP role was created to discourage voters from voting the opposition while giving them the illusion of having an opposition. Why did you think they created that. Because they know idealist like you wants some form of opposition 4. This basically proves my point. You guys are extremely bias to the point of being comical. You claim they don't listen to the ground. They know more about the ground than r/sg. Example, r/sg keeps demanding lifting of covid restrictions. Latest survey shows 26% doesnt want the restrictions removed. Why did you think MMTF is taking their own sweet time. You complain about high minister salary, do you even realize that WP's proposal for ministerial salary is pretty much the same as what the ministers are getting right now? You complain about PAP slip up. Don't forget they are running an entire country. LOTO cannot even manage 1 MP and you want us to replace PAP with that? This is why I say you have no idea what you are talking about because you really have no idea what you are talking about. Your accusations against PAP are mainly false, your illusion of a strong opposition somehow making the country better has not been proven in other democracies and your faith in WP is clearly misguided.\",\n \"Like you said the PAP doesn't need to appoint one, why than do they want to appoint one. To make the WP seem more credible so they will eventually replace the PAP? Of course not, no political party who wants to stay in power would do that. Having a leader of the Opposition gives people the impression that they already have a decent size opposition so the fence sitters don't need to throw sympathy votes at them. It's no different from why they created the NCMP role and why they expanded the numbers\",\n \"Let me just end it with a few questions for you to ponder because based off your latest reply, you have clearly let your emotions get the better of you. 1. What differing views do you deem to be wrong? And by what standards are they wrong? 2. Prosperous for whom? Income inequality is still pretty large. Housing prices are ridiculous. Petrol is at its highest price ever. So I don't think the common folk cares too much about prosperity when they are worry about their rice bowl. Can you list me some countries with strong oppositions? I can name 2 off the top of my head. Australia and New Zealand. Both seem decent enough countries to live in. LKY succeeded not because there was no opposition. It was because he was a good leader and he had a good supporting cast. There is no correlation between the 2. A country can succeed if it has good opposition as well. Again, New Zealand. 3. Of course, I want some opposition. It is to create debate in parliament. Debate promotes thought and adjustment. 4. This is where your emotions have gotten the better of you. Firstly, if r/sg knows more about the ground than them, then we are all doomed. Secondly, who have they surveyed? If my maths hasn't failed me, 26% a percentage that is less than half. So you risk angering 74% of the population by taking your own sweet time? That is clearly bad governance. If WP has indeed proposed such an outcome then we the public will no doubt scrutinise them as well. Who said anything about replacing the PAP? I clearly stated I wanted better leaders from any party. Ministers are elected to serve the PEOPLE this is a FACT. We, the people, have not felt like we have been adequately served for awhile. I think the one who doesn't know what he/she is talking about is you. Are all your views wrong? No. However, to say that someone's elses wish to have an opposition is wrong in its entirety, is something I cannot accept. Have a good day, fellow redditor.\",\n \"I literally answered your post - everything is happening as it should based on the WP's evidence. Even if you allege the COP members have bias, the fact is that they cannot have reached any other conclusion but to refer Pritam to investigation because of the conflicting testimony. So I have no idea what your misgivings are whatsoever - the COP is doing exactly as it should have, regardless of who is on it. We can reconvene an independent panel to review the evidence but they would arrive at exactly the same conclusion...so what's the problem exactly? What conclusion should a supposedly non-biased panel reach, based on the fact that someone obviously lied in their testimony? Not investigate it? Seriously?\",\n \"Not sure how this is so difficult to understand, but I'll simplify it for you: 1. Yes. On the face of it, the COP consists of politically affiliated members, mostly from the PAP. 2. There is potential for conflict of interest, but as always that potential COI is trumped by whether the actual outcome is actually tainted by COI. Reality always trumps supposition. 3. The conclusions reached by the COP were those that would have been reached by any reasonable independent panel, considering the egregious and jarringly conflicting accounts given by the different WP members (not to mention the straight refusal to answer questions). As such, despite any appearance of political bias, the actual conclusion of the COP is obviously one that was inevitable for any independent panel so your attempt to cast COI-based aspersions completely fail to hold up. There cannot be any fault found in the COP's conclusion, if anything they would be at fault for a thorough dereliction of duty if they had not referred the WP leaders for investigation. I hope that's simple enough\",\n \"Pray tell how any line of questioning can lead Pritam to confuse telling RK to confess her lies vs telling her to take it to the grave.

I\\'m all for a healthy opposition, but 1. Why DID Pritam give RK a choice? Should be as simple as saying, \"Tell the truth\" no? Was it ever a question? It\\'s things we teach our children since they were young. Get her to tell the truth then fire her for tarnishing the image of WP, if image is a concern. 2. Why did he have to lie about giving her that choice? He could merely have said that he did give her a choice, expecting her as an upstanding citizen to heed her moral compass. The PAP might have painted a picture of a leader who was laisse faire but definitely less damaging than being investigated for perjury! 3.

That one i can undertand. But you see his reasons for objecting. Cannot la page A26, para 10a-c Mr Tan was invited to set outhis objections, and to discuss them with the Committee. (a) Mr Dennis Tan was of the view that mitigation ought not apply because it would be a“slippery slope to allow someone, some form of leeway, as long as I go and tell my party leader about it”. That MP can then blame the leader for a lack of response orslow response. (b) Mr Dennis Tan said that it was not relevant, whether or not Ms Khan was instructed by her party leaders to lie. He felt that it was a “dangerous line” which would encourageyoung MPs to “run to a leader” to get advice in future in order to absolve them of theirown responsibility because every MP should be responsible for his or her own action.Mr Dennis Tan also said that Ms Khan does not need direction from a party leader onwhether or not to tell the truth in Parliament as every MP must know this. On thisbasis, Mr Dennis Tan was of the view that there should be no consideration of the partyleaders’ role in telling Ms Khan to lie, as mitigation. (c) Mr Dennis Tan said that even if Mr Singh (and Ms Lim and/or Mr Faisal) had told MsKhan to bury the Untruth (as Ms Khan said in her evidence), the onus should have beenon Ms Khan to disagree with her senior party leaders, and insist on coming clean inParliament against their instructions.',\n 'I guess this is the only way out since it now becomes a \"he say, she say\" issue.

There\\'s also the ambiguity of \"I will not judge you\", a phase by Pritam Singh to Raeesah, which everyone can debate on what it meant till the cows come home. Though perhaps, it can be seen as quite a rookie mistake by the Leader of the Opposition to leave it so \"vague\" if the intent was to get Raeesah to own up for her lies there and then. Sure, one can say that Raeesah should have read it differently, then it becomes a bigger issue of how WP assess and select their candidates. Leaders should act like leaders. &x200B; Everyone would have their own sides and interpretation of this saga, but its a fact that we\\'re wasting public resources on this issue caused by WP themselves. And now, it seems like there\\'s going to be more public manpower and resources devoted to this.',\n 'Break it down for you all the important parts of the Report. pg 92 Para 54 - pg 95 para 61 Mr Singh did not tell Ms Khan to proactively clarify the truth on 4 Oct 2021 Mr Singh admits that he did not tell Ms Khan to proactively raise the matter, and clarify the truth on 4 Oct. Mr Singh changed his evidence, when his earlier evidence became untenable While Mr Singh agreed eventually that this was his position (i.e. that he did not tell Ms Khan to proactively clarify the truth on 4 Oct), he had first tried alternate answers. Mr Singh’s change of evidence went as follows: (See paragraph 55 of the Report) (1) At first, he said that Ms Khan had to clarify the truth, proactively, on 4 Oct, even if the issue did not come up. He said that it was “very clear” that this was what Ms Khan was meant to do. (2) It was pointed out to him, by the Committee, that no preparations had been made for Ms Khan to tell the truth (see paragraph 52 of the Report for the preparations that would be needed.) He had said that no preparatory steps had been taken, because it was uncertain if Ms Khan would have to clarify the truth. (3) It was clear at that point, that Mr Singh’s evidence (that Ms Khan would have to come clean, proactively) was not tenable. Mr Singh then changed his position, and admitted that he did not tell Ms Khan to come clean (proactively), on 4 Oct. The above relates to facts; what happened, what did not happen. Mr Singh should have had no difficulties in giving straight answers. But he made up his answers as he went along, answers which he thought were necessary, to save himself, without much regard to the truth (see paragraph 61 below.) The above is one example. The eventual position Mr Singh took was that Ms Khan did not have to clarify the truth if the matter was not raised. The explanation Mr Singh settled on runs into the following difficulties: (1) Ms Khan was to tell the truth only if the matter gets raised in Parliament. (2) The obvious question is: why only if the matter gets raised? Wasn’t it important to have the truth clarified anyway? Mr Singh had himself said it was important for Ms Khan to clarify the truth.64 (He had also said that if a WP MP told a lie, the “minimum” expected was that the MP would have to correct it, and come forward with the truth.) He went to see Ms Khan, specifically to advise her on what she should say. The only thing that Mr Singh should have said to Ms Khan was that she should tell the truth on 4 Oct, regardless of whether the matter was raised in Parliament – if Mr Singh’s intention was that the truth be told. It is telling that he did not say that to Ms Khan. It is also telling that when he was giving evidence, he realised that this was a weakness, and at first tried to say that he had told Ms Khan to tell the truth, regardless of whether the matter was raised. And then he had to backtrack and change his story. Mr Singh’s admission, that he did not tell Ms Khan to clarify the truth, proactively, is consistent with Ms Khan’s evidence, that on 8 Aug, he had told Ms Khan to take the Untruth to the grave, and that on 3 Oct, he essentially repeated that advice. Mr Singh’s explanation for admitting that he did not tell Ms Khan to proactively clarify the truth, on 4 Oct, is also not credible. He said that this was because he was prepared to give Ms Khan time to come to him and say, “Look, Pritam, I’ve spoken to my parents and I’m going to come clean”. (As at 3 Oct, Mr Singh did not know whether Ms Khan had spoken to her parents.) That answer makes no sense. If he did not know whether Ms Khan had spoken with her parents, and if it was important (as Mr Singh said it was), – he would have asked Ms Khan. But he did not ask this simple question. If it was an “immediate concern” that she tell her parents, as Mr Singh said it was, then why did Mr Singh expect (as he claims he did), that Ms Khan should tell the truth, if the matter was raised on 4 Oct? It would be more logical that he would then have said to her: “The matter might come up tomorrow. You will have to tell the truth. Have you told your parents?” He did not do that. On 3 Oct, when he met her, her parents were around in the premises, though they were not part of the conversation. Mr Singh’s explanations show that other parts of his evidence are also untrue Mr Singh’s explanations also show that he was not being truthful when he said that he had wanted Ms Khan to tell the truth if the matter gets raised on 4 Oct (1) This is so because, on his own evidence, Ms Khan telling her parents was a “condition precedent” to clarifying the truth publicly. Yet, Mr Singh says that he did not know if Ms Khan had told her parents, and he didn’t ask. (2) Thus, in his mind, the key precondition to telling the truth had not been met. (3) Since the pre-condition had not been met, based on his own evidence, he could not have asked (or expected), Ms Khan to tell the truth on 4 Oct, even if the matter was raised. (4) That means only one thing: he advised her to repeat the Untruth on 4 Oct, if the matter was raised, and fully expected that she will follow his advice.',\n '> Meanwhile, WP chief Pritam Singh and party vice-chairman Faisal Manap should be referred to the public prosecutor to \"consider if criminal proceedings ought to be instituted\", due to Mr Singh\\'s conduct during the committee\\'s probe and Mr Manap\\'s refusal to answer relevant questions, the report said. 🤨',\n 'Maybe Pritam can hire Edwin for his defence.',\n '\"However, the committee also found that Ms Lim, together with Mr Singh and Mr Faisal, had lied under oath in their testimonies based on evidence it has available. It cited the Aug 8 meeting between Ms Khan and the three senior WP leaders. The meeting, the committee said, was when Ms Khan had confessed about her lie in Parliament earlier on Aug 3, and when Mr Singh had told her to \"take the information to the grave\".\"  &x200B; can anyone explain the above logic to me? so... the COP determined that the 3 WP leaders were lying because they denied saying something that Raeesah alleged they did? genuinely confused',\n 'ITT people siding with WP and saying they should \"drop the matter\" but if Raeesah was instead a PAP member they\\'d ask for nothing less than for her to be thrown in prison',\n 'In short: Pritam fixed Raeesah Sylvia screwed Pritam What a WP vs WP',\n 'Raeesah lied in Parliament with Parliamentary Privileges.

Eh apa ini this WP?!',\n 'Watch this be our equivalent of an Anwar moment. Pritam isn’t gonna be allowed to stand for elections again or something along those lines PAP supporters: We are a more stable country than Malaysia PAP supporters: Yes doing the same thing to Pritam is perfectly fine and normal!',\n \"WHY DID DENNIS TAN OBJECT TO THE REPORT The COP report has dissected, and completely eviscerated Workers Party's position in these proceedings. It is devastating; leaving no doubt that Mr Singh told Ms Khan to bury the lie and then lied to the COP. He also lied to his own party, suppressed information about his own complicity from his own CEC, his own members, his own cadres, and accused Ms Khan of being a mental case. For good measure, he also attacked his long serving cadre members and called them liars. This is about the worst behaviour one has seen in Singapore's Parliamentary history. But perhaps the most devastating comment about the Workers Party is not coming from the COP in its multi-page report. Buried somewhere in the reams of paper attached to the report are the Minutes of the Committee's deliberation on 7 February. Mr Dennis Tan, not surprisingly, voted against the recommendations of the Report (even though there was unanimous consent on the factual parts of the Report). Mr Tan was asked to explain his objections, and the Committee discussed it fully. Paragraph 10 of the Minutes is particularly interesting. When asked to explain why Mr Tan felt that Mr Singh’s instruction to lie would not amount to mitigation for Ms Khan, Mr Tan said “There should be no consideration of the Party leaders role in telling Ms Khan to lie, as mitigation”. He goes on further and says that in fact, even if Mr Singh, Ms Lim and/or Mr Faisal had told Ms Khan to lie, the onus should still have been on Ms Khan to disobey them, disagree and then insist on coming clean in Parliament, against their instructions. I can understand Mr Tan’s reluctance to agree to a Report which damns his own Party leaders (well-reasoned as it was). But it is quite something else to object to the Report on the basis that even if Ms Khan was told to lie by Mr Singh, that would be alright. And that in fact Ms Khan, with a year’s experience in Parliament, as an MP, should stand up against her Secretary General and disobey him. That is not only a completely untenable position, it also gives us a window into the Workers Party's own position and philosophy on integrity. What kind of mindset does the Party leadership have when Mr Tan (as a senior politician and a CEC member) can say that it doesn't matter that Ms Khan was told by her leaders to lie. She can be told to lie by her Party leaders, but it should be her own responsibility to defy and come clean? What does it say about the mindset of the Party leadership? What openness, transparency, integrity and accountability are we talking about? As far as the Workers Party is concerned, it is just talk. They throw these words around a lot, but clearly don’t practice any of it. Talk is cheap.\",\n \"Fuck lah, can we get to actual stuff like policies and shit, not this bullshit. I get it that Raeesah Khan talked shit in Parliament, but if she said things in a more lawyery tone (maybe....perhaps.....I heard from a....) then she would be fine. Not like PAP hasn't have some skeletons in their closet before, pretty sure if a certain person made the RI/ACSI comment while not being on the PAP there would be a subsection of the law dug up to screw him over. If she lied about something actually serious, this would make sense (lying about actual policy, lying about policy figures, lying about elections etc.), but as it stands it really feels like trying to be kaobeikaobu about nothing. I get it, opposition = bad = political instability = bad news, but have some confidence in yourself and believe in the Singapore public to make the right choice during elections. What the heck is all this?\",\n 'Pritam wanted 大辣 but Edwin order 小辣',\n 'I think it time for Pritam to hand over Sec Gen to Sylvia. Hooray! Sylvia for Sec Gen',\n \"RK getting a slap on the wrist while WP leadership is being dragged through the mud. It's clear this is not about RK and her bullshit.

After decades of a PAP only parliament, we FINALLY managed to have two opposition parties and a leader of the opposition. So much work went into making this happen only to have it all crumble down because of one idiot.

The fact that she doubled down in the hearings tells you that she believes she hasn't done anything wrong. In her mind, the people who called out her lies (PAP) and the ones keeping her lies a secret to protect her (WP) are in the wrong. The current batch of SJWs are disappointing. In the earlier days, SJWs actually fought against oppression even at the expense of their lives (Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks, etc). I admire the fight for social justice but SJWs are nowadays inflitrated by hypocritical rich brats chasing social media clout like her.\",\n 'She single-handedly destroyed the political careers of Pritam & Faisal, forever I won\\'t be surprised if in the next coming months Raeesah is found dead in \"suspicious accident\"',\n \"It's true that part of the PAP's motivation for capitalising heavily on this scandal is to misdirect attention away from their unpopular policies. But you got to fault the WP themselves for providing this target for them. What a disappointing performance all around for SG politics.\",\n 'I\\'ve glanced through the findings, and it mainly points to the fact that he allegedly played a key guiding role as a mastermind in perpetrating the untruths. The key fact can be found on page 50 of the . The CoP basically used RK\\'s email on 7th Oct which says: \"Thank you for listening to me, for caring for me and for guiding me through this without judgement\" as proof. If Pritam & co. asked her to tell the truth on 3rd Oct and she flagrantly disobeyed him, she would not be thanking them. There was also inconsistency in his statements - particularly, whether RK was given a choice of action, which was contradicted by Sylvia\\'s statement. Based on the above, the CoP reasonably concluded that Pritam was not entirely truthful in the proceedings, and basically rejected any evidence or statement he gave whenever there is an inconsistency. This can be found on pages 93-95 of the Main Report. And because Pritam\\'s explanations of the circumstances were rejected, the CoP seemed to hone in on the fact that there was no immediate instruction for RK to tell the truth. This also led to the line of reasoning that Pritam \"was the primary cause, the operating brain\" behind the second untruth. (Pages 95-106)',\n 'Lying to the committee is perjury and I think because there were differing accounts between Raeesah and Pritam et al, the committee decided it was best to refer it to the courts for investigation.',\n \"Thanks, glad to see this. > (b) Mr Dennis Tan said that it was not relevant, whether or not Ms Khan was instructed by her party leaders to lie. He felt that it was a “dangerous line” which would encourage young MPs to “run to a leader” to get advice in future in order to absolve them of their own responsibility because every MP should be responsible for his or her own action. This is a very subtle but important thing about how leaders run their organisations, and how it shapes politics. From my impressions of this case, Pritnam looks at his MPs as leaders unto themselves. Leaders like these give a lot more freedom and trust to their subordinates. The PAP, with more mouths to feed, expects a certain degree of top-down direction at a point in the timeline of events. This is reminiscient of armies - where the lowest rugs of the organization are trained to become order takers. Is sticking to the high trust leadership style for a little too long entail to hiding an untruth? Maybe not. But if treated as such SG's political parties are prone to forget the individuals and only have concern for the party.\",\n 'Sympathy only goes so far.

It seemed to be that way too at first. But after watching the committee hearings, especially Pritam's hearing, the focus seemed to have shifted on whether or not the leadership is to be blamed for an action (or inaction) that ultimately rested on RK's decision. I was just wondering if the situation were reversed and that the lie were said in parliament by a PAP rep. Would the upper echelons of leadership then be held accountable for the action of that MP?

If LMW had been nuanced and precise in his argument that there are certain hiring practices that could be characterised as an abuse of the spirit of free trade agreements, thereby being of particular value for even the incumbent to look into (being pro-trade and all), the CECA debate may have gone in a fruitful direction. Instead, what we have is PSP = racist. If RK had any modicum of sense and decorum, and understood the significance of the role that she plays as a Parliamentarian, perhaps she would have made the choice of stepping up to correct the record at the first possible time. Instead, what we have is an existential quagmire threatening the most competent and competitive opposition party to date. I won't even comment on PS, because I still would want (in heart of hearts) to give him the benefit of doubt. The Peter Principle operates by promoting people to the level of their incompetence. Thereafter, they cannot be dislodged. I keep shouting into the void that we should hold WP to an even higher standard than the PAP, because it is in everyone's interest to have an actually better alternative. Instead, people consistently advocate for the Peter Principle.\",\n \"There are other redditors on this page that read the report in detail. From what they read, Singh lied in front of the committee. He first said that he told RK to come clean on Oct 4, but then after more questions by the committee, admitted that he did not. Even worse: RK was able to produce evidence (whatsapp, email etc) that supported her disputed claims but the 3 WP leaders failed to produce any documents to support their claims. Lastly, Sylvia Lim isn't being referred for criminal proceedings because she showed willingness to release documents that would be 'damaging' to Singh's claims.\",\n 'Why did Pritam say nothing? Because during his COP testimony he was not given any opportunity to say what he wanted, instead he had to entertain Edwin’s bollocks and answer what-ifs. His “testimony” was just some bizarre pissing contest. Why didn’t Sylvia say anything? Because she actually did, it’s just not worth reporting.

Interesting interpretation, even before you get to the question of how the PAP ministers in question managed to get into the polling station without crossing this 200m boundary.

This means it is possible to live with Omicron.” > The current Omicron wave is registering daily cases a few times more than that of the Delta wave “as expected”, and the numbers may go up even more, said Mr Ong. > “Fortunately, as we have envisaged as well, it is also a less clinically severe variant compared to the Delta variant.” > At the peak of the Delta wave, Singapore had about 3,200 daily cases with about 170 beds in the intensive care units occupied by COVID-19 patients. > Now, with more than three times the number of daily cases, there are about 20 COVID-19 patients in the ICU, said Mr Ong. > “While our healthcare workers are very busy, stretched, stressed, I think it is a different level of intensity as compared to during the Delta wave.” > However, a large number of daily infection cases is “still a significant threat”, and there are still severe cases that need care, he added. > MORE CHILDREN INFECTED > While hospitals may not be stressed “in the same way” as during the Delta wave, Singapore needs to ensure that there are sufficient paediatric beds because the Omicron variant is more likely to infect children than the Delta variant, said Mr Ong. > Children aged five to 11 currently have the highest infection rate at about 67 per 100,000, followed by those aged 12 to 19, with an infection rate of about 55 per 100,000. > “This is quite different compared to during the Delta variant wave, which mostly infected older and working adults. With more children and young people getting infected, severe cases are inevitable, and we need to ensure that there are sufficient beds for them,” said Mr Ong. > Public and private hospitals are setting up more beds for children, and COVID-19 treatment facilities are also converting more beds for children and their caregivers, he added. > “Fortunately, children admission to hospitals and CTFs due to COVID-19 are often precautionary in nature, with short stays of about two to three days. Notwithstanding, it is important to get them vaccinated to protect them against the risk of severe illness should they get infected.” > Vaccination against COVID-19 and boosters continue to make a “significant difference” to the outcomes of those infected, said Mr Ong. > Of Omicron patients, 0.3 per cent need oxygen supplementation or ICU care, he noted. This figure is 1.8 per cent among seniors aged 60 and above. > However, there was “a big variance” depending on vaccination status. For example, among the elderly, the severity rates for those who were boosted, fully vaccinated, and not fully vaccinated are about 1 per cent, 4 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. > “Hence, a senior above 60 and not fully vaccinated is more than 10 times likely to fall severely sick when infected with Omicron, compared to someone who has received the booster shot. > “That is why vaccination and boosters, especially amongst seniors, continue to be our key priority,” said Mr Ong, noting that more than 60 per cent of Singapore’s population have received their booster shots. --- 1.0.2      \",\n 'And LW is better?

My 2-cents are that the PAP government will go by the letter of the laws, that\\'s no auto renewable of 99 year leasehold except on very few unique cases. However, there will be other form of subsidies for the residents to purchase/rent places elsewhere when the lease runs out. The above is based on PM Lee\\'s 2018 National Day Speech. It is also essentially how PAP had managed the \"difficult to swallow pills\" like GST in the past. Take from the left, give to the right proportionally. Raise GST, but give universal but tiered rebates. It\\'s a form of wealth redistribution. >Personally I don\\'t think this policy was well thought out. A land value tax would have likely achieved an identical economic and land use goal without any of the non-linear nonsense that occurs at the 99th year. It would also be fairer because 99year leasehold is essentially a very heavy tax that gcb and freedholders (ie: the rich) don\\'t pay. I disagree with this. A land value tax cannot address one of the main drawback of a freehold lease for public housing, \"aging of property\". In private freehold properties, which the owner has the means to move to their second or third home while rebuilding or extensive reconditioning of aging buildings. On the other hand, most HDB dwellers do not have such secondary places of residence to stay while their primary residence is undergoing rebuilding or extensive renovation. Logistically speaking, it will be much simpler to permanently relocate the HDB residents of aging flats to their new flats than to provide them with temporary housing for months or even years. Hence, a 99-leasehold scheme is a logistically more viable. A land value tax for freehold HDB cannot resolve the aging issue. EDIT: My above hypothesis will be thrown out of the window if PAP does not form government. This is a distinct possibility which many Singaporeans choose to ignore. Depending on which part(ies) forms the government, they may opt to extend the 99-year lease and kick the can down the road.',\n 'Your write-up says nothing about the \"aging\" issue. Regardless if the residents are in fact, the original buyers, the aging problem is still present. It\\'s not about if the original buyers are residing at the place, but how to manage the current residents for major renovations or rebuilding. >Also are we arguing that we need a 99 year lease arrangement because sinkies are incapable of finding alternative accommodation during renovation and rebuilding and that they need govt hand holding. Yes. Not just alternative accommodation, but long-term AND still temporary accommodation for months and even years. You may live in a world where this is not an issue for yourself. But in the real world, to find such accommodation for an entire block or even an estate of residents is a big issue. Many people simply don\\'t have such resources and will need government\\'s help. Let me give you some real examples. There are wheelchair bound residents who really want to stay at the ground floor. There are families with nearby relatives who are taking care of their children/seniors while they are at work. They want to stay in the same estate. There are people whose sole income is from renting out their flat rooms. They need places which allows subletting. Etc. Etc. It\\'s already a difficult issue to permanently relocate them. To find a temporary residences for so many people with so many different needs at the same time is a logistical nightmare. You may not believe that this is not a real problem. But it really is. >but that is not going to be as simple as you say. I think you took away the wrong message here. I didn\\'t claim it\\'s simple or easy. I am hypothesizing that that\\'s the approach PAP government will take. Was GST, COE or NS \"simple\"? I don\\'t think so. But PAP went ahead and did them anyway. Your solution of LVT is not a complete solution. It may address the \"rent-seeking\" issue. But it does not resolve the \"aging\" issue which you sidestep. EDIT: >There is nothing stopping a government from using LVT revenue to buy out homeowners in order to redevelop an estate. Those homeowners can then buy relocate with the side of grants etc, like they do now. This is just leasehold with extra steps and/or costs. If the purchase is mandatory with fixed price, then it is no different from leasehold in effects. You are just taking the money from owners via LVT and giving it back to them at the end of the \"lease\". The drawback compared to leasehold is that the \"lease\" duration is hidden and at the \"whims\" of the government. On the other hand, if owners are allowed to negotiate the price, then the other taxpayers will be held hostage and bear the increased costs. EDIT 2: I like that you are bringing in experience from other countries like Malaysia, HK, and, China. While they do bring some insights into the challenges of this issue, I will argue that the \"setbreak\" for China is not due to \"cannot\", but \"will not\". CCP does not see this as an issue which they will want to bulldoze through. If they do, they can make it happen. In my view, PAP\\'s public stand is that it will stand its ground. Finally, I want to compliment you on the good writeup, especially in your original post. However, I fear that this thread of discussion will become too contentious which is not my intention. I was aiming to present an alternative viewpoint, which may be wrong. But I believe does have merits. Alas, due to the constraints of internet comments and culture, as well as my lacking communication skills. I feel that it is heading towards a heated argument direction which I have no interests to pursue. All the best.',\n 'My comment about it being \"heated\" is more of my state of mind rather than the content of our discussion. Thanks again for your detailed writeup. In case it\\'s not clear to you, I was not against your points about LVT per se. I agree that it\\'s a viable method for the \"rent-seeking economy\" issue. But leasehold has one important advantage which a LVT lacks. It\\'s ability to tackle the \"aging of property\" issue in a predictable and transparent way. Nothing of what you had said so far, suggested that your proposed LVT is going to be better than \"leasehold\" approach with regards to this issue. At best, it\\'s comparable with some drawbacks (via compulsive land acquisition OR open-market prices). Leasehold owners know exactly when the lease will end and their property becomes \"zero\" in value. This predictability allows them to plan far ahead, years or even decades. A LVT with compulsory acquistion does not have this important feature. I\\'m not arguing against LVT per se. But more to point out one key issue which I feel that you are sidestepping or minimizing its importance. As for your opinion about CCP with regards to leasehold issue, I will just say that I don\\'t agree with it. Especially with the statement that \"suddenly all this were to evaporate.\". That\\'s not how leasehold works in theory. It works precisely because of its predictability. The value won\\'t evaporate suddenly, but gradually over its lease period. CCP will not collapse just because it wants to enforce leasehold by the letters of the law. Because the value of leasehold properties don\\'t evaporate \"suddenly\". If the value of Chinese leasehold properties do evaporate suddenly, it would have nothing to do with leasehold being enforced. That\\'s not what leasehold is about at all. But in practice, due to lack of political will of some countries, leasehold of public housing tends to get extended indefinitely. This results in \"aging\" issue and also removes its predictability feature. Finally, I agree with your statement about the importance of messaging.

It's either collecting for the sake of collecting (i.e., fulfil KPI, hygiene theatre) vs collecting for non-pandemic uses (there's precedence for it being used for criminal investigations).\",\n \"> as much as I don't like the TT, what do you think should happen when new variants emerge? > > cancel TT now and reinstitute TT after new variant is identified? Let's flip the conversation.  Should we accept the inconvenience and intrusion into our private lives that comes with carrying a Government-sponsored tracking device that I'm mandated by law to use in the absence of a currently known credible threat that requires us to use it?  Was TT any use whatsoever at identifying and isolating Omicron contacts?  Will we ever return to Zero Covid where a system like TT has any value? If we are not able to use it for the intended purpose and we're not going back to a Zero Covid world then we ought to jettison this permanently. It served a purpose, that purpose has now been completed, now it may be misused for a purpose it was not specifically designed for.\",\n \"TT is already useless now, because i) the infection rate is too high, especially with omicron, for contact tracing to scale; and ii) with almost the entire population fully vaccinated, the mortality and severe symptoms rate of the newer variants, especially omicron, are just too low for TT contact tracing to be worthwhile. Even MOH has admitted that they only do targetted tracing now, for nursing homes, hospitals and a few other places. By all means, keep TT for those places, but remove TT and SafeEntry for those places where it's already redundant, like malls. If a new variant emerges, the variant has to have both i) lower infection rate than omicron; and ii) much higher fatality rate for vaccinated people, for a rational person to even consider TT again. If that does happen, i don't think you will find strong objections to reinstating TT, if it is cancelled now. However, such a variant is quite unlikely. The history of pandemics suggest that viruses evolve to become more infectious but less virulent over time. This happened before with the Spanish flu pandemic and is also happening now with Covid, where omicron is more infectious than Delta but less virulent, especially for a fully vaccinated person.\",\n \"Was your father asked to upload his TT data or handover his token? >My father got infected some time back and communicated this with MOH. What kind of weird scenario is this? If you test positive, MOH will tell you what to do. Under what circumstance did your father find out he's infected and yet have to tell MOH himself? Was it self-swabbed ART, which isn't counted? Some people are being issued Health Risk Warnings apparently on the basis of TT data (they don't live in the same home as the patient). These people aren't required to stay home. They need to do an ART each day before leaving the house for 7 days.\",\n '> i) the infection rate is too high, especially with omicron, for contact tracing to scale As far as I can tell, contact tracing through TT is automated and can easily scale. When you are infected, you have to upload your TT data or give up your token, then by some mysterious algorithmic criteria, people who are deemed to be close contacts receive automatically generated SMSes putting them on Health Risk Warning. >Even MOH has admitted that they only do targetted tracing now, I think this refers to cluster reporting, not contact tracing.',\n 'How would TT reduce workload on healthcare infrastructure in the face of Omicron? The new MOH protocols have done much more to reduce hospital workloads (by diverting mild cases away from hospitals) than any TT contact tracing could hope to achieve now.',\n 'It seems that they are using TT to help in manual contact tracing rather than sending out notices algorithmically, as what you are suggesting. It could be that a subset is sent out automatically. Here are the relevant paragraphs from the article: \"Prof Mak was responding to a query from Yahoo News Singapore on the extent to which contact tracing is still being carried out, given that there are thousands of new COVID cases each day while the city-state transitions to the endemic phase of the pandemic. The MTF did not respond to Yahoo News Singapore\\'s additional query on when the use of the controversial TraceTogether app, which aids contact tracing, might cease. In January, it was revealed that the police are empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code to obtain TraceTogether data for use in criminal investigations, despite earlier assurances to the contrary from then Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan.\" For the four examples you gave, only1 was due to an unrelated person. The other 3 were due to colleagues, friends or relatives. This suggests that manual tracing was done instead of automatic notices. It is possible to do it algorithmically, but that would require MOH having social network information in addition to TT data. I would be quite uncomfortable with that. Finally, let\\'s do some back of envelope calculation on what happens if notices were sent out automatically to everyone. The bluetooth range for detection is about 10-30 meters. With that range, you can easily come into close contact with at least 10 people a day if you visit a hawker center or shopping mall. Suppose you take 3 days for period of infection, then we are looking at 30 notices per infected cases. With 3000 infected cases, that\\'s 90K a day quarantine, which looks unrealistic. So at best, a small subset of HRW was sent out automatically. i suppose you could call it something that \"scales\" but how effective is it anyway? In the last Delta wave, our infection rate wasn\\'t really better/lower than the infection rates during the Delta waves in Europe or the US. We have better hospitalization/death rates, but that is probably due to more people being vaccinated, a better healthcare system and less obese people. TT at best can help with infection and it doesn\\'t seem like countries without such an intrusive device is doing worse than us during the Delta wave in terms of infection.',\n \"The best part about WFO is not the easier collaboration with colleagues, it's not the commute creating a thick boundary between work time and personal time, it is that I don't have as many dishes to do at the end of the day.

(ST, Jan 29) \"Out of the woods: Elderly man to enjoy first CNY reunion at home after over 30 years\" \"Mr Oh Go Seng is looking forward to his first Chinese New Year in a warm home setting in more than 30 years. Just last month, home was a makeshift tent made of nylon canvas and wooden sticks in a forested area in Sungei Tengah, where he grew his own vegetables like chilli padi and pandan leaves. The 79-year-old had been living in the forest for the past 33 years, since his kampung home in the same area was cleared. In the past, Mr Oh would celebrate Chinese New Year with a duck and split it into a few meals over four to five days. That was a rare treat for himself. On normal days, though, his three meals would be mostly porridge with preserved vegetables he prepared over an open fire. He cleaned with water from the pond and wore clothes donated by well-wishers. \"I have never seen snakes, just chameleons and mosquitoes. They are my friends. They don\\'t harm me,\" he said in Hokkien. His wife, who is in her 50s, and daughter, 19, live in Batam and are not aware of his living conditions. He sends them about $500 monthly, drawn from his savings from his past work as a labourer. His daughter is reading medicine, he said, though he does not know which local university she is in. He used to visit them regularly, but the pandemic has stopped him from doing so. Mr Oh\\'s plight came to light when he was caught selling vegetables in Teck Whye Lane without a permit last Christmas day. He had lost his job as a pasar malam odd-job labourer during the Covid-19 pandemic two years ago, and his money was running out. All his vegetables were confiscated, and he was let off with a warning. The incident was filmed by passer-by Vivian Pan, who uploaded it on Facebook. When contacted, the 36-year-old, who owns a company offering cleaning and painting services, told The Straits Times: \"The old uncle felt very lost after the incident. I brought him to the market nearby and asked the stallholders if they could give him some space to sell his vegetables. Then I went to the Chinese temple to see if he could set up a stall there. Nobody could help.\" However, help did come unexpectedly. Ms Pan\\'s video went viral and caught the attention of a grassroots volunteer, who heard that Mr Oh has a relative who lives in Bukit Panjang. Its MP, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, was alerted. On discovering that Mr Oh did not even have a roof over his head, Mr Liang and his volunteers reached out to the relative to ask that she offer him a temporary shelter while they assisted him with securing a HDB rental flat. The relative, Madam Lim Kah Choo, daughter-in-law of Mr Oh\\'s brother, said she met Mr Oh three years ago at the funeral of her mother-in-law. They lost touch after that. Mr Oh\\'s brother has died. \"I asked him if he was doing fine then, and he told me he was living alone \\'in the garden\\',\" she said in Mandarin. \"I thought he meant that he lived in a small house near a garden.\" When the 59-year-old cleaner found out from the police and grassroots volunteers that Mr Oh had been calling the forest his home all these years, she was \"heartbroken\" and welcomed him into her five-room flat in Bangkit Road. Mr Oh moved in with her and her family a week ago. He also collected the keys to his one-room rental flat in Choa Chu Kang a few days later. The grassroots volunteers are assisting him with the repair works and furnishing. They will also be delivering a bed, pillow and bedsheets to his new flat. Mr Liang, who had dinner with Mr Oh and his relatives on Jan 20, said: \"At his age, I find his resilience and tenacity in life most remarkable and heartening.\" He added that once Mr Oh has settled into his new flat, volunteers will work with the local grassroots leaders to find him community spaces to grow his vegetables. Mr Oh also found a job as a gardener at a horticulture company which pays him about $1,200 monthly, though he now has to work and save doubly hard to pay his rent.

The PAP have to do a lot to win over male votes. A lot of men are starting to realise that men are not getting the good end of the bargain despite ST’s continuous barrage of articles insisting otherwise. Issues such as this would generate political consciousness and make such voters hard to win over. Once someone is conscious of the flaws of the party, it would be hard to win them back on just one issue. Males have a lot of exposure to the flaws of the government, with NS being one of them. But, to make it fairer for men where there is unfairness would also run afoul of the interests of the feminists and some female voters, who for some reason believes vehemently that they are the ones getting the bad end of the bargain. Let’s face it, despite all the talk of “gender equality”, who really wants it? Most people in both sides just want to be the one getting the better end of the deal. The easy way for the government is to double down. Males that are apolitical are unlikely to be that affected enough to defect to the opposition in bulk, since they have a pretty high tolerance. Males that are politically conscious are too hard to woo. There’s no reason to provoke apolitical females when they are the party’s vote bank. Politically conscious females might be won over with feminist policies if you convincing them that they are oppressed and keep heaping privileges on them. I don’t expect the government would change and care about true gender equality and neutrality. They have the bulk of one half of the population to capture. They only need to capture most of the female half of the population and that will guarantee them victory in elections for decades to come.',\n \">The government have been hard at work wooing feminists and women with recent comments and pushes, such as rejecting a gender neutral name for the Women’s Charter and the slew of ST articles about how women are severely disadvantaged, etc. I just want to highlight that AWARE has been pushing for equal spousal maintenance and renaming of the Women's Charter to family charter.

Let’s bet something. Despite all the talk of gender equality, PAP will never dare to seriously bring up female NS in the next decade. Despite all the cries of lacking in manpower and all that, the PAP has been very quiet in trying to broach this topic. In fact, the Enlistment Act does not specify that only males are to be conscripted, and in the definition section, a “person subject to this Act” is simply any citizen and PR above 16.5 years old and younger than 40. With decling birth rates, the SAF is lacking manpower. Gender-blind conscription is also a form of gender equality. Conscripting the other half of the population as the Enlistment Act allows for is logical. Conscripting women also help to move towards being gender equal and being gender-blind. Hits two birds with one stone. So, why do they not do it? Let me guess. It’s fucking unpopular to the group that gets affected if conscription is expanded to them. Is that not a proof? Is that not counted as chasing the female voters by keeping it quiet about and pushing away from instituting an extremely unpopular move? >\\tNo women is going to read the news about how they are stubbornly sticking to their guns to refuse equal spousal maintenance and think: thank goodness for PAP thinking I’m the weaker sex, I’m gonna vote them in again. Do you dare to say in the bigger picture that no woman is voting for the PAP because of their feminist policies? You harp on a specific part of the topic and yet use it to dismiss the broader topic as a whole. >\\tPlease stop thinking that women are so myopic and vote solely because you think that PAP is giving women more rights. Like I said in the earlier paragraph, you are the one being myopic by fixating on a small part of the issue. Looking at the bigger picture, why shouldn’t women vote PAP? With the PAP, a woman can be sure that their daughters would not need to serve NS. With the PAP, a woman can look forward to more “gender diverse” workplace and “gender equal” salaries and wages. With the PAP, a woman enjoys great protection under the law for areas that women are traditionally vulnerable in, and the PAP has a record of being a staunch defender of it. With the PAP, a woman often gets out of a divorce with a better deal, a situation the PAP is reluctant to change, and in the backdrop of increased divorce rates. Under the PAP, a woman can look forward to a choice of pursuing a career or staying at home. Those who choose careers can look forward to reduction in barriers. Those who want to stay at home can hold their husband hostage if the husband does not agree, and if the marriage breaks down, many can look forward to getting significant support out of their ex-husbands and allow them not to work. Under the PAP, a male can look forward to a two-year delay to entering the workforce, putting males behind females and competitive foreigners. Males can only choose career or career. If a male dare to insist on being a househusband and the marriage breaks down, the male is likely to get fucked by the Women Charter unlike a female. I don’t know about you, but if I am a woman, I will gladly vote PAP. Why shouldn’t I, right? Unparalled freedom, traditional woman or career woman or something else, the choice is there. Any fallout in a marriage, the woman benefits. There are few responsibilities without consent and no onerous unconsented civic responsibilities. Singapore is for the most part safe, and sexual crimes are dealt with (unlike in other countries and in Raeesah’s imagination), and there is large visible push in dealing with it. This is why so many men are complaining about gender inequality instead. In terms of law, Women’s Charter fucks men in a failed marriage and NS is an onerous unconsented civic responsibility. The law makes it clear that the traditional responsibility of a man to take care of the women and young is not going anywhere (see Women’s Charter). In terms of freedom, a career is all a man can look forward, the government made little attempt to normalise alternative paths (such as househusbands) and society and women still looks down on “unambitious” men. Career wise, that onerous civic responsibility called NS do rear its ugly head sometimes, putting men 2 years behind competitors. Oh, and how about male victims of sexual offense and false accusations? Male victims of rape is not recognised, males are discouraged from seeking help. Best of all, male victims of false sexual accusations get their lives ruined by having their face and names plastered on national media, while their accusator remains protected behind anonimity, and very little recourse is available to that sorry situation. Topping it off, the government felt there’s little impetus to fix that sorry situation or go after the accusators publicly, giving excuses despite it having occured! This is the bigger picture.

given the need to > shift its approach from “just-in-time”, where costs are reduced by keeping inventories lean, to “just-in-case”, where “buffers and stockpiles would become the new planning parameters”, as PAC chairman Foo Mee Har noted. > The other members of the committee are MPs Cheryl Chan, Louis Chua, Derrick Goh, Henry Kwek, Poh Li San, Saktiandi Supaat and Tan Wu Meng. > The committee said it was concerned about how disruptions to the global supply chain would impact costs for the Government. > \"Apart from supply chain concerns, other new inflationary risks and vulnerabilities would affect government spending and may require adjustments to financial governance processes and internal controls,\" the PAC added. > In response, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) pointed to four strategies it has in place: building a strong buffer of financial resources, diversifying sources of supplies, considering the establishment of commercially viable local production sources for certain supplies, and stockpiling essential supplies. > The ministry said that as an example, it is encouraging agencies to use a combination of fiscal and non-fiscal regulatory measures to enhance resilience while exploring if costs could be shared with other stakeholders. > MOF said that when calibrating the level of government spending, it will consider the effects of inflation and also the macroeconomic impact of the government spending in itself. > The ministry also works with agencies to ensure forward planning, diversification of supply, and the development of contingency plans. > When it comes to essential goods and industrial supplies, the Government would likely play a more direct role to ensure food supply resilience as the market would not naturally provide for an adequate level of resilience, said MOF. > On the other hand, industrial supply chain disruptions are commercial risks which should be mainly addressed by companies, with limited government involvement, if at all. > Another area the PAC was concerned about was the attendant risks and impact on governance, controls, oversight and accountability with greater adoption of work-from-home and hybrid arrangements in the public sector. > To this, the Public Service Division (PSD) said that even as it shifts towards hybrid work settings where telecommuting becomes a permanent feature, it has put in place measures to ensure citizens and businesses can continue to access services seamlessly, and service standards to ensure feedback is reviewed in a timely fashion. --- 1.0.2      ',\n '>  Longer work hours may be unavoidable for business continuity amid Covid-19: Employers > SINGAPORE - As the Republic grapples with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, employers and observers say that workers might need to put in extra hours to ensure business continuity, even as some of them may be under strain amid a blurring of the line between life and work. > This is due to the variant being more contagious - though less severe - thus potentially sidelining a significant proportion of the workforce. > With one in two Singapore workers already putting in more hours at work since the pandemic started, according to a survey commissioned by The Straits Times in January, the existing life-work imbalance may deepen with the Omicron wave. > The survey, in which more than 1,000 respondents participated, also found that middle managers bore the brunt of most additional workload, with six in 10 reporting putting in extra hours at work compared with about five in 10 for junior staff and senior management, reported ST on Monday (Jan 24). > The top reasons respondents cited for that imbalance were difficulties drawing boundaries with work-from-home arrangements, increased tasks such as more paperwork, and covering for colleagues who have quit. > Boundaries can be hard to draw in a work-from-home environment because the office environment provides structure, routine and separation between work and home, Dr Jaclyn Lee, chief human resources officer at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, told ST on Wednesday. > \"Travelling to and from work provides a mental break and winding down from office affairs,\" she added. > Mr Sim Gim Guan, executive director of the Singapore National Employers Federation (Snef), told ST: \"In the event that their co-workers are absent due to sickness, stay-home notice or self-isolation, existing workers may have to pick up the slack to ensure business continuity.\" > Both Dr Lee and Mr Sim suggested that employers minimise communication after work hours. > Mr Sim said Snef helped a group from the Alliance for Action for Work-Life Harmony to develop a template for an after-hours communication policy that employers can adopt. > Released last September, the template includes sections that outline the responsibilities of employees and human resources managers. For instance, human resources managers should ensure employees are not \"unduly penalised\" when they are unable to respond to work-related matters after-hours. > Challenges employers face include crafting human resource policies that balance between operational needs and preserving work-life harmony, said Mr Sim. > \"Sometimes, even though their employers have such policies, employees may think that their performance appraisal may be affected if they do not respond after working hours,\" he said, adding that setting clear expectations is required for these policies to work. > A spokesman for the Public Service Division said agencies in the public service are encouraged to implement \"focus days\" without planned meetings, which allow officers time to focus on deep work and learning, as well as designating low-tempo periods for officers to take leave to rest and recharge. > Said the spokesman: \"As the Public Service moves towards embracing hybrid work in the Covid-19-resilient future, the issue of blurring work-life boundaries could become an issue if not managed carefully.\" > Mr Ang Yuit, vice-president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said middle managers bear the brunt of coordinating among employees who are working different hours throughout the workday, as these employees juggle personal responsibilities, such as childcare, with work. > Nonetheless, longer working hours are not a permanent solution, he said, adding that small and medium-sized enterprises should formalise staggered work hours and adopt a goal-based approach to management, rather than focusing on the number of hours spent on a task. --- 1.0.2      ',\n '>  SPH Media Trust to focus investments in talent, tech to deliver quality journalism: Khaw Boon Wan > SINGAPORE - The SPH Media Trust (SMT) has spent the past months building up its talent pool and technology capabilities, and will continue to focus on these two key areas as it pursues its mission to deliver quality, credible journalism, said SMT chairman Khaw Boon Wan on Thursday (Jan 27). > In an update on the entity that was officially spun off from newspaper publisher and mainboard-listed company Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) on Dec 1, Mr Khaw said SMT will invest heavily in these two areas, adding that the Government has agreed, in principle, to support some of the initial investments that may take a longer time to recoup. > He added that discussions on funding with the Government as well as other organisations, such as clan associations and community groups, had been going well and an announcement would be made on the matter \"quite soon\". > He was speaking at a media briefing along with SMT interim chief executive officer Patrick Daniel, English, Malay and Tamil Media Group editor-in-chief Warren Fernandez, and Chinese Media Group editor-in-chief Lee Huay Leng. > Mr Khaw, a former minister who came out of retirement to head the not-for-profit entity, said that the newspapers under the former SPH had underinvested in talent and technology in the last few years and \"those are the two big pieces of gaps where we have to make the corrections as soon as we can\". > To this end, SMT will invest heavily to set up a Media Academy that will focus on honing the digital skills and multi-media capabilities of its journalists. > It will also invest aggressively in technology to improve user experience for those using its publications\\' apps and websites, for instance, and to ensure that the newsrooms can get content out in a timely and effective way. > These investments are necessary for SMT to fulfil its mission of being a trusted source of credible news, as well as promoting the mother tongue languages, cultures and values, connecting with the community, and growing its international reach, said Mr Fernandez, who is also editor of The Straits Times. > In this regard, the SMT stable of newspapers have been helping readers to make sense of daily statistics and policy measures during the Covid-19 pandemic, and had put all content on the coronavirus outside the paywall. > Mr Fernandez said SMT will also set up a fact-checking service to debunk fake news, so that public debate can be informed by reliable information, and will partner with community groups to get the vernacular papers into the hands of younger readers so that they can learn about Singapore\\'s languages, cultures and values. > The SMT stable of newspapers will also work to expand their reach internationally by beefing up the overseas bureaus of The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao and also building on the two publications\\' strong audiences in the region and beyond. > \"These are the purposes that we need to achieve, and these are the roles we have to play in our society.

Here was the response from Assoc Prof Faishal Ibrahim (Minister of State, MHA): >Mr Speaker, the requirements in respect of the cordoning of entrances and exits of buildings as part of the COVID-19 safe management measures aim to also not increase the fire safety risk. Building owners must continue to comply with fire safety requirements and ensure that the exits and entrances that are cordoned off must be readily accessible during emergencies. For example, the physical barriers that are used as cordons must be easily removable to allow evacuation in an emergency. Clear notices or signage must also be prominently placed to inform the public. > >The Singapore Civil Defence Force has communicated the fire safety requirements to all building owners and will continue to conduct regular enforcement checks to ensure compliance. Mr Giam added: >I am sure the Minister would appreciate that, during an emergency, time is of the essence and there is often a great deal of panic and confusion. So, while it may be that the emergency exits remain open, the fact that they are out of bounds in normal circumstances might condition people to rush to the one exit that they know remains open and that could become a choke point. So, has SCDF considered this risk and how does it intend to mitigate that, beyond what the Minister of State mentioned just now about having signage to ensure that people are aware that the exit can actually be opened. MOS Faishal\\'s response: >We recognise that it is important for us to let the public know and be socialised about how the exits and entrances work during an emergency. As such, it is important that we work very closely with the malls and building owners. SCDF has been doing that and has been encouraging malls and building owners to inform their customers and those who go to the buildings about some of the safety aspects and, at the same time, place clear signage. In fact, we are heartened that Singaporeans are also very concerned about fire safety. If you follow the media, quite a number have written to the media to share their concerns. As such, we have also been engaging building owners regularly. I would like to urge members of the public, that if they have concerns about fire hazards, they can call us at 1800-280-0000 use SCDF\\'s \"myResponder\" app or email us. This is something that we believe in and want to work with the public on, and while we will continue to manage and enhance our system, as well as engage the public and building owners. > >We are very heartened that Singaporeans have come on board and are making sure that Singapore, regardless of the situation that we are in, with the various Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place, will continue to look at and ensure fire safety.

Their Town voted for Trump by 35% or something like that . They are doing pretty well for themselves. Their relationship is officially recognised. Their community is pretty supportive. Their church ( presbyterian) was not willing to marry them, but otherwise seem pretty chill about dealing with them. Church communications to them refer to them as 'Mr and Mr xyz'. And this is the state that is the LEAST supportive of gay marriage in the US. Gay marriage in the US is a dead issue. Trump and most of the republicans know that they can't stir shit about this anymore and have instead moved on to going after trans people.   &x200B; In Alabama, the state that is typically memed as full of stupid red-neck, evangelical neanderthals, 33% support gay marriage and 38% oppose it. Polled in 2019, it is likely that this figure has moved even more favorably towards supporting gay marrage in the last 3 years. 70% of Americans as a whole support gay marriage in 2021  Meanwhile, in Singapore, in 2019, only 16.4% of Singaporeans support gay marriage ( 60% oppose and the rest don't care). Heck, You are more likely to find support for gay marriage among Trump supporters ( 22%) in Alabama than among Singaporeans. So Singapore is less supportive of gay rights than the least educated, least economically successful political bloc with the worst life outcomes in one of the poorest, least educated, most conservative, most anti-gay states in the US In 2021, polling suggests that 55% of US Republicans now support gay marriage.  I think a strong case can be made that Singapore is a lot less tolerant of lgbt people than even the worst corners of the US. One of the reasons that Singapore keeps attracting American grifter pastors to earn money preaching hatred of gay people to morons is that the customer base for this kind of bullshit in the US is rapidly dying out. So they are moving on to pushing this nonsense in places like Singapore where there are an abundance of cretinous authoritarians who will happily hand them money in exchange for a moral panic. The US is exporting hate and we are importing it because there is arbitrage to be had in our diverging political values.

GST vouchers mean that, on balance, GST is not a regressive tax for the poor. This is nonsense because there\\'s absolutely no reason why GST vouchers as a scheme has to be tied to GST itself. We could just rename the \\\\$300 payout every year to the needy as a \"social support basic income\" (to preempt the other nonsense of \"where is the money gonna come from other than GST\", I have many suggestions, including jacking up property tax especially on luxury property, tweaking the income tax schedule to tax higher earners more, abolishing the PA (and mayors), cutting defence spending, actually holding Temasek accountable for their relatively poor financial performance, etc. the possibilities are abundant). The 7% GST itself, however, in terms of the actual tax levied on goods and services, is almost certainly regressive, since the poor spend a disproportionate amount of their income on basic living expenses. Note that this argument does NOT preclude GST raising more money from the rich than from the poor: for someone who has $1 million, they may lose $100 more to GST, but this impacts them less as compared to someone who has $1000 and loses $10 more to GST. Also, note that I am NOT claiming that Singapore\\'s overall taxation system is regressive - it\\'s not - but that GST specifically is regressive. The GST voucher scheme is just obfuscating GST\\'s regressive nature because, again, there\\'s no reason that it has to be tied to the GST itself. &x200B; 2. Increased GST --> increased government revenue --> increased spending on the poor. This would be great if it weren\\'t so idealistic. A cursory glance at the breakdown of Singapore government spending would tell you that for every dollar the government spends, only about 4 cents goes to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (see ), this being the ministry that is most directly administers welfare programmes (for reference, about 13.8 cents on every dollar goes to MINDEF and about 7 cents on every dollar goes to MHA). It is true that, on the whole, the poor receive more from government spending than they are taxed, but again, this is not directly related to GST itself, since we could maintain an approximate or slightly lower level of social spending even with current/ slightly lower GST levels (for reference, GST was about 12% of government revenues last year from the link above). &x200B; We can argue the merits or demerits of GST on other grounds - I personally buy that it is an extremely efficient tax collections-wise - but please, no more of these two spurious arguments.',\n '>  Commentary: Why the need to raise the GST now? > SINGAPORE: When then Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, announced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike in 2018, he said it was necessary to strenhen Singapore’s revenues, given increases in recurrent spending on healthcare, security and other social needs. > He said the GST would be raised from 7 per cent to 9 per cent sometime between 2021 and 2025, depending on the state of the economy and public finances, and likely earlier rather than later within this period. > The GST hike was held off last year as Singapore grappled with the economic fallout of COVID-19. However, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated in his recent New Year message that the Government will have to “start moving” on the hike in Budget 2022 as Singapore emerges from the pandemic. > Several questions may come to mind. First, what exactly is driving the increase in public expenditure that necessitates a higher GST? Second, can Singapore tap other revenue streams in lieu of raising the GST? Third, what impact will a higher GST have on lower-income Singaporeans, particularly as inflation picks up? > AGEING DEMOGRAPHIC AMONG THE KEY DRIVERS > Since the GST was last raised in 2007, and even before the pandemic, public expenditure has grown significantly. Between 2007 and 2019, government spending rose from S$33 billion to S$75 billion a year. > Social spending nearly tripled over this period. Government healthcare expenditure, in particular, soared from S$2.2 billion to S$11.3 billion. > The surge in healthcare spending comes as no surprise, given Singapore’s demographic transition.

A spokesman for the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) told The Straits Times on Wednesday (Jan 19) that almost all of Singapore\\'s population above the age of six are on board the programme. It did not provide specific numbers. This comes even as about 3,000 users deregistered from the programme last year. SNDGO said that this forms 0.056 per cent of registered users, and that such cases include long-term pass holders who have left Singapore as well as people who have died. It also includes those who have requested to opt out of it for data security reasons. Then Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan said last May that 1,155 users of TraceTogether had requested to opt out of the programme. The TraceTogether programme, which identifies people in close contact with a Covid-19 patient via a Bluetooth-enabled app or token, came under the spotlight a year ago when it was revealed that its data could be used for criminal investigations, despite earlier assurances that it would be used solely for contact tracing. Legislation was subsequently enacted to restrict the use of contact tracing data to investigations of seven categories of serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, rape and armed robbery. When a user deregisters, all registration data, including his NRIC and contact number, is deleted from the TraceTogether server within three to five working days. This means that all the Bluetooth data that a person\\'s device has exchanged with other devices will no longer be associated with him. Given the rising number of coronavirus cases and the overall shift to treating the disease as endemic, some have questioned if TraceTogether and national digital check-in system SafeEntry remain necessary. Both these systems remain important to Singapore\\'s fight against Covid-19, and they will be kept for now, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). MOH adopted a \"comprehensive and aggressive\" contact tracing strategy at the beginning of the pandemic before vaccines were available so as to slow disease transmission, but the approach has shifted given Singapore\\'s high level of vaccination.

MORE ON THIS TOPIC Police can use TraceTogether data for criminal investigations Updated TraceTogether app shows vaccination, test statuses on SafeEntry check-in SafeEntry is now used to check the vaccination status of individuals before they enter venues, while TraceTogether is used to alert individuals through health risk warnings to their recent exposure to cases so that they can take appropriate precautions. \"These digital tools also allow us to identify possible places of higher-risk exposure, and help to guide public health actions such as the need to adjust safe management measures,\" said MOH. It added that it will regularly review the relevance of existing rules and requirements. Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, expects that the use of these digital tools will stop soon given Singapore\\'s high inoculation rate. \"Right now, their main function is to document vaccination status. With our high vaccination rates, that is likely to be unnecessary in the future,\" he said. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore\\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, foresees that while these tools will not be necessary in the long term, there is still a need for these digital tools for at least the next 12 to 18 months. \"I expect there will be some degree of vaccine-differentiated measures that will be necessary even in an endemic Covid-19 situation, and if so, there will be a need for a platform to register and verify vaccination status,\" he said. \"Whether TraceTogether and SafeEntry will continue to be used for this purpose, especially in entering premises permitted only for vaccinated people, will depend on how long we intend to continue with vaccine-differentiated measures.\" &x200B; &x200B; The bot not here I help you copy paste.',\n '>  Nearly all in Singapore are on Covid-19 contact tracing programme TraceTogether > SINGAPORE - Nearly all the people in Singapore are now on the national Covid-19 contact tracing programme TraceTogether since its launch 21 months ago. > A spokesman for the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) told The Straits Times on Wednesday (Jan 19) that almost all of Singapore\\'s population above the age of six are on board the programme.

Rather, it\\'s a continuation of the very traditional patriarchal mindset that women need special protection. When this maintenance issue was raised years ago in Parliament by NMP Kanwaljit Soin (a founding member of Aware) it was a male PAP member that declared that \"call me a male chauvinist but its a man\\'s duty to provide for his family\" to much hearty thumping by his fellows. So please stop with the anti-woke bull.',\n '>So far your response is indicative of the mentality of the general population in Singapore which is \"men got problem meh? See aware got help also what.\" Men in Singapore have problems. NS is one of them, along with stuff like suicide, toxic gender roles, work culture, etc.. However, let\\'s all also be clear here that NS is a law imposed by the Government, which is run by men. NS is thus a valid problem faced by men, but it is important not to conflate it with problems faced by women, or worse suggesting that \"because men have NS, women should have some equal penalty too\". This is because women aren\\'t the ones keeping the NS policy in place, it\\'s the mostly male government. Men in Singapore have problems. The way to solve these problems might be to set up a men\\'s organization that can offer specialized services to men. There is currently nothing preventing the creation of such an organization. That\\'s why the other guy is answering your question of \"where are specialized services\" with \"well you can set one up\". AWARE provides specialized services to women. Men do not have specialized services right now. I think the obvious answer is for someone to set up specialized services for men, rather than complaining about AWARE. Specialized services to all, rather than forcing AWARE to give specialized services to men (which they might not even be qualified for). AWARE already goes out of its way to push for various gender neutral initiatives, like the renaming of the women\\'s\\' charter to family charter, and making spousal maintenance gender neutral. Yet they are still generally reviled online as \"crazy feminists\". I am not sure what else people expect AWARE to do, other than to somehow become a man\\'s organization as well.',\n 'Soo TT is gonna update on the feb14. What about those who gotten covid?

Tried calling MOH but they seemed busy :/',\n 'SINGAPORE — Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin has said that while he would like to be more open in allowing freer debates in the House, it does not mean that parliamentarians have free rein \"to take liberties to do whatever they so wish\". Mr Tan did not say what prompted his Facebook post on Tuesday (Jan 18), however his comments come a week after a terse exchange in Parliament which ended with him stopping Progress Singapore Party member Leong Mun Wai from asking a question and telling him to sit down. “If every member decides to speak and debate and question just because they feel like they ought to, it’d be chaotic and it would be inappropriate,” Mr Tan wrote on Facebook. “In these instances, when members are so denied that space to speak, it is because they have been out of order or there are no provisions for them to do so.” And when that happens, Mr Tan said that his role as Speaker is to ensure discipline and to maintain dignity and order in the House. His post included a series of infographics produced by Parliament on the rules for conduct in the House, which highlighted that the speaker may direct a Member of Parliament (MP) to stop speaking if the MP persists in “irrelevance or tedious repetition”. “These rules are not meant to restrict,” Mr Tan said. “Rather, it manages the space so that we can be consistent, fair, allow business to proceed and provide time for more members to speak.” THE EXCHANGE LAST WEEK On Monday last week, Mr Leong, a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, had asked Education Minister Chan Chun Sing about feedback he claimed to have received from residents \"that some teachers have already practised vaccination differentiated safe management measures in schools\". In response, Mr Chan said that the authorities had no plans to implement infection controls tied to vaccination status for children aged 12 and below in schools and asked Mr Leong for the name of these schools. Mr Leong said that the feedback from the residents was in WhatsApp messages and that he would need to refer to them before making a clarification. The next day, Mr Leong told the House that the complaints he had brought up originated from a Telegram chat group called SG Concerned Parents, and that the messages there did not name any schools. Leader of the House Indranee Rajah rebuked Mr Leong for making the unsubstantiated claims, describing the NCMP’s explanation on Tuesday as an attempt to “grandstand” or make broad speeches that have no bearing on the details requested by the Education Minister. A terse exchange between Mr Tan and Mr Leong followed. When Mr Tan asked if Mr Leong had taken the point made by Ms Indranee about the need to exercise the privilege to speak in Parliament responsibly, the NCMP tried to ask another question but was stopped by Mr Tan. “I\\'m asking you whether the point is taken,” Mr Tan said. “If you have no response to that, you can sit down. Thank you very much.\" ‘HOW TO DEBATE LIKE THAT?’: LEONG MUN WAI Since then, Mr Leong has commented on Facebook that his fellow NCMP Hazel Poa and he have been repeatedly stopped from speaking. “You haven’t seen how many times they have stood up and prevent (sic) Hazel and I from speaking. How to debate like that?” he wrote last Wednesday. Mr Tan, in his Facebook post on Tuesday, said that he expects parliamentarians to be able to substantiate what they say in the House. He wrote: “In most instances, members have been responsible and mature in their behaviour and conduct, and there has been little need for me to crack the proverbial whip or I guess to wield the Mace! “But if I need to be firm, I will not hesitate to do so. It’d certainly be remiss of me to do otherwise.” Mr Tan, when asked what sparked his comments on Facebook, referred TODAY’s query to a Parliament spokesperson who said that the organisation routinely posts explainers such as this to educate the public on parliamentary processes. Mr Leong, meanwhile, has not replied to TODAY\\'s request for comment.',\n 'A genuine concern relayed, gets pushed back for grandstanding. The typical PAP response. Feels like Indranee was grandstanding for her colleagues.

Many times complains come in via anonymous means and with Singapore G known to be extremely petty and zealous in clamping down dissent, there must be cases of actual people suffering but don’t dare to put up identifying details. This added with the lack of resources of oppositions make it tough and perhaps unreasonable to demand full set of details and evidence when simply raising questions. Tbh I don’t see it necessarily bad to just ask ministers to address rumors. They can easily smack it down and for example whatever CCS said in Parliament will be enough for schools to think twice about implementing VDS measures, or any small VDS measures previously unmentioned to be revoked. As long as LMW didn’t press his point about it being more than a rumor, or embellishes his point I think it’s ok.',\n 'This is fair enough but I think the flip side is that it\\'s hard for the Government to disprove rumors or allegations embedded or implied within the questions without details. Over time, these unsubstantiated allegations can unfairly cast doubt on the integrity of the public service. In LMW\\'s case, he also didn\\'t frame the question without making it sound an allegation. (However, it is important to note that unlike RK he did not lie, a fact that seemed to be lost on many) He could have said something like \"There are rumours spreading of X. I have no reason to believe these are credible but to dispel potential misinformation, can the Minister confirm and reassure Singaporeans that X is not the case.\"',\n 'And in similar fashion, CCS could easily say “this didn’t happen, please check your sources” and everybody moves on with their lives. I’m still not sure why this is an epic song and dance and pearl clutching. LMW didn’t keep insisting his source is correct - he openly declared his source and then moved on. Should he not ask pertinent question because rumors came from dubious sources? I gave reasons why we should allow it. Problem only comes when we insists dubious sources are right after clarification.',\n 'I will quote LKY since his legacy lives on and the government largely keeps to his vision of Singapore. >\\tTwenty-five years ago, Singapore’s national unity was uncertain. We had many different racial groups mostly immigrants who spoke different languages and dialects. We never had a common religion. The majority are Buddhists, with significant groups of Christians, Muslims and Hindus. Religion cannot be a force for national unity. Indeed, secularism is essential for inter-religious harmony for our multi-religious community. Singapore does not have a king or sultan. Nor do we have established political parties which alternate in power. All Singapore has is the PAP. We went through a period of great peril and crises in the 1950s and 1960s. For over two decades, the alternative to the PAP was the CPM (Communist Party of Malaya). >\\tOur experience of crises in the 1950s and 1960s made Singaporeans acutely aware of the vulnerability and fragility of our society. Fortunately we are a pragmatic people and so we set out to build on our common interests and to mute our differences. In the 50s and 60s, we have two special riots. The Maria Hertogh riot and the 1964 Race riot are the special mentions. I would think it is the latter that would have a greater impact of LKY (and thus subsequent leadership as they continue with his vision). The latter is a serious foreign attempt (by UMNO of Malaysia) to destabilise SG, and with the idea that Singapore was a nation surrounded by enemies (which we were at that time), it was a serious weakness that our government will no doubt be aware. In that context, we can see the reasons why such aggressive protection of religious and racial harmony was put in place. The context between religious and racial groups and marginalised groups are very different. Marginalised groups are probably never viewed as a threat or a serious danger to the government (by definition, marginalised groups have little influence or power). Our government isn’t famed for being very caring of marginalised groups. For example, migrant workers are one and we all know what happened in the past two years. LGBT groups are not a priority to the government. Let’s face facts. While younger people are more accepting, most younger people wouldn’t take a stance on it. Remember that protest outside of MOE? It’s not like it triggered a really strong wave of support. It just fade off so rapidly. Don’t talk about older people, which are far less accepting. Oh, add in declining birth rate and a top heavy population pyramid, guess what, the LGBT movement isn’t something the government is going to seriously care and commit themselves to. The fact that none of our main opposition parties have a concrete stance against it also says a lot about the reality. You ask me why religious groups we protect but no one protect the LGBT, I tell you why. Politics. One has a very serious impact, the other not so much. If you are the political leader, why shouldn’t you focus on the former and ignore the latter? It’s common political sense! >\\tMore importantly, it’s damning that it’s always the same few religions that constantly need their feelings protected. Weird. Let me give an analogy. What makes karens overrepresented in in viral videos about negative behaviours? Why aren’t there so many non-karens? If certain groups are more likely to do something that leads to a certain outcome, of course they will be overrepresented.

There was no timeline communicated. > OCBC introduced my relationship manager's manager on Jan. 3, after the scam had by that time gained widespread coverage in mainstream media. > The RM's manager was to provide an additional contact point. > However, there is also no update from him unless I reach out first. > I messaged him after reading about the “goodwill payment” news in the media on Jan. 17, which was the first time I heard about it. > His response was that my case is still undergoing investigation. > I would appreciate Mothership’s help to ask OCBC, based on what criteria do they select the 30 victims, and whether this “goodwill payment” will extend to all victims? > We have heard that some victims do not qualify. > I hope that all victims will be treated fairly as guided by MAS. > No alerts, no warnings from bank > OCBC shared in a statement that they had since Dec. 3 issued multiple alerts and warnings to its customers using multiple channels, including security alerts and advisories on its website, Internet and mobile banking log-in pages, customers e-mails, as well as social media channels. > I disagree with this as on the date of my incident on Dec. 20, there was no such alert on the mobile app and nothing on this scam on their social media feeds. > When I had informed my relationship manager of the scam incident on Dec. 20, he responded over WhatsApp, “wa this one really never see before”. > If internal communications to staff were non-existent, I would like to question the bank: Show proof of their so-called security alerts and advisories since early December? > On Dec. 23, OCBC got a narrative published in an article in The Straits Times: “OCBC cautions public about SMS scams after customers lose $140,000 in 10 days”. > But these scams had taken place from Dec. 8 to 17 with a clear time lag for such a grave matter. > Public awareness of this scam only swelled on Dec. 30 when a police statement mentioned that S$8.5 million had been lost to scammers and victims started sharing their stories with the media. > Clearly, OCBC did not act fast enough and were not proactive enough to embark on more widespread paid and earned media communications that could have prevented scams that happened after early December -- until their reputation was affected. > SMS messages that were sent on Dec. 30 and Jan. 4 were clearly too little, too late. > The OneToken failure > It is notable that OCBC has stopped the compulsory rollout of their clearly flawed digital token OneTaken since the scam. > In 2021, I had to replace my physical token because it expired. > As my mobile device was not compatible with the OneToken, OCBC had issued me a new physical token even though it was to be phased out as they knew I couldn’t activate the OneToken. > However, scammers were able to set up the OneToken on their device without additional verification from me, which allowed them to bypass my physical token security. > OCBC should have better processes (e.g. a physical one-to-one meeting, phone call) with the client to activate such significant changes to account access. > What goodwill payment? > While OCBC shared that they have begun to make goodwill payment to the victims (apparently 30 victims), it has not applied to my case, which I assume is one of the largest amount of losses. > For my case, the bank has shared that as it is “complex”, and it will need “more time to investigate”. > Just want to be compensated > It has almost been a month since I have lost the S$500,000, and I have not heard a single update from the bank on my case even though they claimed they have “a dedicated team set up to support the victims”. > While I am encouraged by the cases of the fellow 30 victims, I wonder how much these payments will be for large amount of losses like my case. > I hope that it is a genuine effort to treat victims fairly as per the latest statement by MAS on Jan. 17. > I sincerely seek MAS’ close attention on how all the individual cases are being investigated and compensated. > I hope that you can share my story so that there is more sustained public awareness to this scam and to encourage OCBC to expedite this remedial process for the victims so as to put an end to our trauma and distress. > Were you scammed in the recent OCBC SMS phishing scam?

It is expected to cover a land area equivalent to about 667 football fields, and was earmarked to provide future capacity for the airport to ride on the projected growth in air travel. > It was to handle up to 50 million passengers a year in its initial phase. > This, along with Terminal 2\\'s (T2) upgrading works, would have increased Changi Airport\\'s total passenger handling capacity by about 65 per cent to around 140 million passengers a year. > But in a sign that recovery has not progressed as fast as initially hoped, the suspension of operations at T2 has been extended. > The terminal was supposed to be closed for 18 months from May 2020, but has not reopened even after the 18-month mark passed in November 2021. > Changi Airport Group told The Straits Times on Monday that the airport plans to resume T2 operations in phases, in tandem with traffic recovery. > The MOT spokesman said on Monday that passenger traffic at Changi Airport has reached about 15 per cent of the levels before the pandemic by the end of December. Further recovery is expected in 2022, she added. > National University of Singapore Law School\\'s Professor Alan Tan, whose specialisations include aviation law, said that a further delay to T5 would be unsurprising, given that construction is impacted by the lack of workers sourced from overseas as well as problems in the supply chain of building materials. > But Associate Professor Volodymyr

span of a few hours in the recent OCBC phishing scam after unwittingly divulging their account details and OTPs to scammers. > Almost all of the victims who Mothership spoke to shared that they had clicked on phishing links sent via SMSes that appeared in the same thread as all the other official OCBC messages. > The victims said post-scam that they had no reason to believe that the messages in the thread were not to be trusted, given that the channel has been used to transmit authentic messages before. > Not hard to spoof SMSes > After the SMS phishing scam became national news, one Singaporean data scientist, who goes by Captain Sinkie, or ZP Lee, shared with Mothership just how easy it is for scammers to send SMSes, with the suggestion that the authorities clamp down on such practices. > How the SMS scam works > Various organisations and banks in Singapore use sender IDs in their SMSes to customers. > This refers to the text display name that users will see at the top of their message threads. > It also indicates who the text message is from, instead of an unfamiliar phone number. > SMS protocol > Lee, 31, said the scammers were able to spoof the SMS protocol by adding a \"sender ID\" field on SMS services. > Users\\' phones will then show these messages with the modified sender IDs. > Phones are also coded to group messages by sender IDs, so the spoofed messages will appear in the same thread as previous messages sent by the official sender. > Technology not new and \"extremely easy\" to do > Lee, who also teaches programming classes, was curious how the scammers were able to pull off this ruse. > It only took him a couple hours of researching the Internet for him to find an SMS service that allowed him to write code and send messages with fake sender IDs to himself. > Despite thinking that it would require sophisticated technology to execute, he found it \"extremely easy\" to do so. > He also told Mothership that this technology is not new and would not require any special software or a lot of processing power if scammers wanted to mass send these spoofed messages out to many people at once. > Managed to spoof messages from DBS, SAF, Grab and more > Documenting his experiments, Captain Sinkie said he managed to spoof messages from DBS Bank, warning that OCBC is not the only bank or organisation that is vulnerable to these sorts of SMS scams. > This was the message he managed to send to his own phone number: > His fake message appeared together with his previous legitimate messages from DBS Bank. > He said he has alerted DBS of his findings. > He even managed to spoof messages from \"72255\", the number that SAF sends out reservist reminders from. > He said he was also able to do the same for other companies, such as Grab, and government agencies like the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF). > Steps taken to prevent spoofing > However, since his initial blog post went viral, most of these organisations have blocked spoofed SMSes from being sent using their sender IDs. > He was also unable to spoof OCBC\\'s messages, presumably because authorities had blacklisted the spoofed sender IDs after multiple reports of the phishing scams emerged. > Petition for IMDA to enforce SMS sender pre-registration > Upon further research, Lee found out that certain countries require pre-registration for organisations to be allowed to send custom sender IDs. > Currently, Singapore does not have this regulation. > According to Twilio, one of the major communications companies that help businesses send messages with custom sender IDs, 51 countries require pre-registration to send out custom sender IDs. > Some countries, such as South Korea and the United States, have also banned custom sender IDs from being sent out completely. > Lee has since started a petition appealing for the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to regulate and enforce pre-registration for sender IDs in Singapore. > Doing so, he said, would help to guard against SMS spoofing scams. > At the time of writing, the petition has garnered almost 1,300 signatures. > IMDA urges more businesses to sign up for anti-SMS spoofing registry, but it might not be enough > IMDA published a forum letter in The Straits Times on Jan. 17 urging more businesses to sign up for its SMS sender ID registry pilot in light of the recent phishing scams. > IMDA said it had launched the Singapore SMS SenderID protection registry pilot in August 2021 together with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). > ST confirmed that OCBC had already signed up for the pilot, but the bank did not specify when it did so or if it was only after the recent highly-publicised scams affecting the bank\\'s customers. > However, while Lee acknowledged that this pilot is a \"good step forward\", his opinion is that it is not a foolproof method for guarding against spoofed SMSes. > This is because it requires companies to proactively register for its use. > \"Companies who have not registered are still vulnerable to targets of phishing scams, such is the case of the OCBC attack,\" said Lee. > He added that the approach also requires IMDA to actively blacklist certain SMS sender names from use. > \"Scammers can still creatively come up with new phishing names to dupe potential victims. Scammer could use names like POLIS, SOS, WIFE, SGPAYNOW, etc. As long as these names are not registered by companies, hackers are still able to come up with authentic looking phishing messages to scam money. This also means that we are always on the backfoot when it comes to dealing with the SMS phishing scams,\" he said. > Lee\\'s petition hopes to address this by urging the government to consider using a \"whitelist\" approach. > This would effectively block all sender IDs from being changed by a third party. > Instead, it would require companies to register for certain sender names before they can be used to send SMSes. > Scammers would be unable to spoof SMS sender IDs using this method. > Though spoofed SMSes are just one way that scammers can deceive people into divulging personal details, Lee hopes that requiring sender ID registration would put an end to similar SMS scams in the future: > \"Already, 51 countries around the world require a registration process before specific sender names can be used. Many more countries such as US and UK outright block sender names from being used. I think it is a fair and logical solution. Too many Singaporeans have lost their hard earned savings and we should work together to stop this.\" > Just one part of the problem > Lee warned, however, that Singaporeans still need to be wary when it comes to entering any details on phishing websites. > \"Even if the SMSes look very legit, hackers will still need to redirect you to a phishing website to steal information,\" he said. > He said there is still a pressing need for Singaporeans to build awareness of phishing attempts, and to be able to identify suspicious phishing links. > Follow and listen to our podcast here > Top photos via Captain Sinkie. --- 1.0.2      ',\n '>The Facebook post claimed that the location was at a multi-storey car park at Block 229 Compassvale Walk, which is in Sengkang.

However, during lull periods, men should be free to do whatever they want, provided they perform during actual training. My experience a decade ago was that the bulk of training was BS like COC parades, area cleaning, filling up seats for nonsense SAF events and the like, and of course, the countless uniform checks to make regulars look good. If theres nothing training related to do at certain times, let men better themselves in whatever way they see fit. Those who want to learn driving should be allowed to go off in the evening. Those who want to supplement their income by giving tuition in the evenings should be allowed to. Those who just want to stay in and read books and prepare for uni/work life should not be hampered from doing so (my unit actually banned books at some point).

Whats new.',\n 'SINGAPORE - She was spotted on a bench at Woodlands MRT station three days after Christmas at around 11pm and mostly spent her time scrolling through her mobile phone. At around 1am, Madam Jane (not her real name) curled up on the bench, which was lined with cardboard, tucked her small bag under her head, and fell asleep. The 60-year-old Singaporean was one of around 10 rough sleepers, along with a group of foreign workers, The Straits Times observed nightly at the station between Christmas Day and New Year last month (Dec). Responding to queries, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the number of rough sleepers who have received support from the ministry and its non-governmental partners has risen five-fold compared to figures pre-Covid-19 pandemic. There were at least 200 individuals who were in shelters in March 2020, but from April 2020 - Singapore entered a circuit breaker from April 7, 2020 to June 1, 2020 to arrest rising Covid-19 infections - to November 2021, the number in transitional shelters and Safe Sound Sleeping Places (S3Ps) grew to over 1,000. Said an MSF spokesman: \"During the circuit breaker period in 2020, many rough sleepers were displaced as safe-distancing measures were implemented and public spaces were closed. \"Many came forward to seek assistance. This led to a sudden surge in demand for shelter as more were willing to seek shelter support.\" MSF, along with support groups like The Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers Network, had put out an urgent call during the circuit breaker for the community to offer premises as S3Ps. And many responded. There were seven organisations operating S3Ps before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and it increased to more than 40 during the circuit breaker, offering over 900 spaces, in contrast to the 100 spaces pre-pandemic. Among the group were community clubs, mosques and churches. Said the MSF spokesman: \"At the peak in May 2020, we had a capacity of 920 spaces in 45 S3Ps. Since the circuit breaker period in 2020, we have supported over 1,000 rough sleepers.\" \"As of Dec 30 2021, there were 25 S3Ps offering around 200 spaces,\" added the spokesman. Madam Jane, though, has declined shelter or other forms of assistance. With the Woodlands station toilets open and a charging point for mobile phones near the facility, she finds it a convenient spot to sleep at night. \"I have a home but it has taken so long for my ex-husband to sell our Tampines flat,\" she told ST. \"I don\\'t have children and I have not told my siblings (about my situation) because I don\\'t want to trouble anybody.\" Close by on another bench, Ronald (not his real name), still wearing his supermarket uniform, was preparing to retire for the night on his makeshift bed. The middle-aged man said he wakes up early every morning, washes up at the toilets at the station and heads off to work with the first wave of commuters just before 6am. The Singaporean, who works in Sembawang, was not willing to share much, and only said: \"I\\'m not homeless. But I decided to move out from my flat and live like this for one year due to a family matter.\" While Madam Jane and Ronald claim they have homes, others don\\'t. ST also spoke to a metalwork specialist from Malaysia who spent the nights sleeping on a metal bench at the edge of the train station. The man, who declined to give his name, said he was in his 30s. He has not returned home since March 2020. \"I\\'m out of luck finding a reasonably-priced flat to rent. I used to share a room but my roommate has returned home,\" he said in Malay. Mr Abraham Yeo, 40, a volunteer for Homeless Hearts of Singapore, is worried the number of rough sleepers could grow as the wait for rental flats is now longer, rental costs have increased and vacancies at shelters and hostels are dwindling. Mr Lam Sheau Kai, president of SMRT Trains, said \"staff have not noticed rough sleepers in the vicinity of Woodlands station recently\". \"If our staff come across rough sleepers on the station\\'s premises, they would advise them to find alternatives and notify the relevant authorities,\" he added. The rough sleepers ST encountered at the station last month said they occasionally receive cash donations and food from commuters. A staff member at an eatery at the station sometimes leaves burgers at the sleeping spots. On that post-Christmas night last month, when asked if she had eaten, Madam Jane showed a bun she was saving. \"I survive on very little,\" she said. \"The toilets are open and I have a place to charge my mobile phone near the female toilet. \"Sometimes people give food or money.

When she cited unreasonable behaviour as the reason for their marital breakdown, Alan (not his real name) felt he had to defend himself and fight back against her allegations. The acrimony that ensued from the divorce also affected their two teenage sons. Alan described the divorce process as traumatic, adding: \"It was just digging up dirty laundry and it got uglier and uglier. \"At the end of the day, both of us were at fault and nobody wins.\" Last Monday (Jan 10), amendments to the Women\\'s Charter, which covers non-Muslim divorces, to allow married couples to divorce by mutual agreement was passed in Parliament, with the aim of reducing acrimony in the divorce process. Divorce by mutual agreement will be introduced as a fact cited to prove that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. This new fact is an alternative to the three fault-based facts - adultery, desertion and unreasonable behaviour - and the two non-fault based facts, where a couple must have been separated for at least three years with consent to the divorce, or separated for at least four years if there is no consent. In 2020, the top reason for divorces under the Women\\'s Charter was unreasonable behaviour. This was cited by 58 per cent of the women who filed for divorce that year, according to the latest statistics published by the Department of Statistics (DOS). While Alan\\'s divorce was finalised a few years ago, he said he doubts he would have chosen the divorce by mutual agreement option even if it was available then. For one thing, he said, he and his former wife were unable to talk \"civilly\" or agree on many matters related to their children and finances. He said: \"I was very angry with her. I feared losing my children, I feared others would look down on me and I was also worried about my finances. \"I wanted to make her suffer more than me.\" Alan\\'s experience underscores a point that family lawyers have highlighted: That the divorce by mutual agreement option is not for everyone. Still, it offers a less painful divorce process for couples who can part amicably. Going by questions from various Members of Parliament, there are concerns that this new divorce by mutual agreement option makes it easier for couples to end their marriage, and worries that it will lead to an increase in divorces. To these, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling said: \"I would like to emphasise that the divorce by mutual agreement will not lead to a quick and easy divorce.\" She described at lenh the safeguards put in place to prevent couples from seeking an easy way out. Couples choosing to cite this new fact have to agree their marriage has broken down beyond repair and explain to the court the reasons that led them to this conclusion. They have to show their efforts at reconciliation and their considerations in post-divorce arrangements involving the children and finances. The courts can order these couples to go for counselling or mediation, for example, and also reject their agreement to end the marriage if it considers that reconciliation is \"reasonably possible\", Ms Sun said. Besides, all the other current safeguards, such as the requirement that couples must be wed for at least three years before they can file for divorce, still apply. Lawyer Dorothy Tan noted that couples citing divorce by mutual agreement cannot file for divorce unilaterally, unlike those who cite the facts of unreasonable behaviour, desertion or a separation of four years without the spouse\\'s consent. Ms Tan said the safeguards for the new fact are comprehensive, and to some extent, even more onerous than the existing facts. Not only do couples have to comply with all the existing safeguards, they also have to state in detail their reconciliation efforts and post-divorce considerations involving the children and finances, among other things. For many estranged couples, communicating with each other about such matters - not to mention coming to an agreement - is almost impossible, Ms Tan said. As lawyer Angelina Hing pointed out: \"For both parties to agree on anything when the relationship is strained is no easy feat and should not be taken for granted.\" Lawyer Thian Wen Yi pointed out that divorce by mutual agreement is the only fact that requires couples to show what they have done to try to reconcile. Lawyers also said the court will not just simply rubber-stamp these couples\\' agreements, but it will have to satisfy itself that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Ms Sun said in her Parliament speech: \"If cases where previous efforts at reconciliation were few and insufficient, and where reasons provided on the breakdown of the marriage appear vague and arbitrary, and where parties do not seem entirely certain of their decision, the court may choose not to accept the agreement.\" In her speech, Ms Sun noted concerns that some couples may ask their lawyers to frame the court documents to show that they have tried their best to reconcile, even though this may not be true. She said divorce lawyers must continue to behave ethically and provide proper advice in line with the principles of therapeutic justice, where the focus is on helping couples heal and move on instead of seeing the other party as an adversary. Ms Hing said that even without the divorce by mutual agreement fact, couples and lawyers who want to \"game the system\" would find ways to do so now. For example, there could be couples who collude to say they have been separated for three years, when it is not true, and they kept their lawyers in the dark, she said. The lawyers interviewed pointed out that a dishonest lawyer runs the risk of facing sanctions if professional conduct rules are breached. As lawyer Wong Kai Yun said: \"Why would lawyers put their entire livelihood at stake to game the system for one client? That would be really silly, and I can\\'t imagine any lawyer being so foolhardy.\" Ms Sun has said the Ministry of Social and Family Development does not expect the number of divorces to increase significantly with the introduction of divorce by mutual agreement, which is expected to come into effect next year (2023). This is because there was no significant increase in divorces during past transitions of the divorce regime, she said. Before 1980, the grounds for divorce were all fault-based. But in 1980, the \"irretrievable breakdown of marriage\" - to be proven by any of the facts of adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion or separation - became the sole ground for divorce here. A simplified divorce track was also introduced in 2015 for couples in uncontested divorces who can agree on all divorce and ancillary matters, such as child custody and maintenance. Data shows that the increase in the civil, or non-Muslim, divorce rates between 1982 and 1986, after the regime switch, averaged only 9 per cent year on year, compared with an average of a 26 per cent rise year on year from 1976 to 1980. From 2013 to 2015, the average number of civil divorces was 5,364. This figure rose just slightly to 5,461 divorces from 2016 to 2018 after the simplified divorce track was introduced in 2015. The new divorce by mutual agreement option will offer couples who are able to part ways amicably a divorce process that is less painful. And if some couples can end their marriage amicably, why should the law put them through the wringer by offering predominantly fault-based facts that will invariably increase tension and affect the children, the lawyers interviewed said. As they said, people do not divorce on a whim, and making the process less painful would not induce more couples to end their marriages. The two issues must not be conflated.',\n '>  Employers may find it hard to look after well-being, safety of maids if they live out: MOM > SINGAPORE - Employers may find it more difficult to look after their maids\\' well-being and safety, if these workers were to live apart from them, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). > Employers will also need to take responsibility for their maids if they break the law or sustain injuries while living separately, it told The Sunday Times. It was responding after some Straits Times Forum letter writers suggested relooking employment rules to allow maids to live apart from their employers. > Under the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations, migrant domestic workers (MDWs) must stay in the same residence as their employers. Any other residential address must be approved in writing by the controller of work passes. > MOM noted that there have been \"only a small number of cases\" where MDWs were found to be living separately from their employers. > There were 245,600 MDWs in Singapore as at June 2021, according to MOM. > Earlier this month, ST reported that there were more than 50 requests from employers and maids on social media in the past year for live-out arrangements. > Live-out maids, who enjoy the privacy such arrangements bring, can be paid as much as $1,500 a month, which covers their rental, transport and food expenses. This is double what some maids here get every month. > They know it is illegal to live outside their employer\\'s home - without approval from the authorities - but say it is a secret agreement. > In its reply, MOM said it is aware that \"some households may require domestic services, but are unable to accommodate a MDW in their homes due to space constraints or a preference for privacy\". > For such households, the ministry urged them to consider the Household Services Scheme (HSS), which allows employers to engage help for part-time services such as home cleaning, grocery shopping and car washing instead of hiring a MDW. > These workers from approved firms can be deployed to multiple houses on a part-time basis. They live in accommodation provided by their companies. > HSS companies are currently allowed to hire female workers from countries such as India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Cambodia. This is in addition to the existing approved countries in the service sectors, such as China, Malaysia and North Asian sources, including Taiwan and South Korea. > The scheme - introduced as a pilot programme in 2017 - was made permanent in September 2021 following an increased demand. > For example, professional cleaning service company Amahs On Wheels charges $380 for four, once-a -week cleaning sessions in four- and five-room Housing Board flats. A pet-sitting session costs $30 per hour on a weekday, or $50 per hour on a weekend, at a minimum of three hours per session. > MOM added that it will continue to monitor demand from households and assess if the scope of services under the HSS can be further expanded. --- 1.0.2      ',\n '>  MOH conducting pilot for virtually supervised Covid-19 antigen rapid tests > SINGAPORE - Those who need to take a supervised Covid-19 antigen rapid test (ART) can now do so over video consultation with a private healthcare provider. The results will be sent to users of the service via SMS and e-mail as quickly as within four hours. > A pilot programme to assess the feasibility of real-time virtually supervised self-swab ARTs is being conducted, the Ministry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times on Sunday (Jan 16). > MOH said it is looking into expanding the options to facilitate regular self-testing and to complement its existing network of physical test centres as Singapore transitions towards living with Covid-19. > The pilot programme involves healthcare start-up Doctor Anywhere, which launched its tele-ART service last Tuesday. > The service makes it more convenient for people returning on vaccinated travel lane flights to take their day three and day seven tests. > The results for virtually supervised pre-event and pre-departure tests are also valid, depending on the requirements of the destination countries. > To book a tele-ART appointment, members of the public must download the Doctor Anywhere app. > Doctor Anywhere charges $12.84 for the service, which does not include ART kits. > During the 30-minute consultation, the person taking the test will have to keep his video camera on and ensure that the ART kit is visible so that results can be verified by the swab supervisor. > Ms Ivin Yew, director of projects and strategy at Doctor Anywhere, told ST that precautionary measures are taken to ensure that Covid-19 test results are accurate. > For instance, before the test begins, users will be asked to check that all parts of the ART kit, such as the swab stick and testing reagent, are unopened. > The swab stick will also have to be inserted to a depth of about 2.5cm in the nostril. > Dr Raymond Ong, a senior doctor at Doctor Anywhere, told ST that it is hoping to serve 1,000 users in the first week of the launch of the tele-consultations. He hopes the service will be able to meet approximately 30 per cent of the demand for supervised self-swab ARTs. > Dr Ong said: \"We see an acute need to make Covid-19 testing more widely available and accessible. For us to get back some sense of normalcy, it is important that we ensure testing is blended into our normal lives.\" > MOH said that the outcomes of this pilot will inform the licensing requirements and safeguards needed to ensure the veracity of test results from virtually supervised testing. --- 1.0.2      ',\n \"Obviously it's training for route march next time in NS - partnership between MOE and Mindef\",\n '>  Over half of S\\'pore\\'s population have been boosted, about 42,000 get Covid-19 shots daily > SINGAPORE - Over half, or 51 per cent, of the total population in Singapore have taken their booster shots, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post marking the milestone on Sunday (Jan 16). > Noting that more individuals are stepping forward for Covid-19 vaccine boosters, Mr Ong said: \"Now, about 42,000 individuals are getting boosted a day.

However, ticket sales have been temporarily curbed until Jan 20 to buy the country time to gear up for the next wave of infections. > Healthcare protocols have also evolved to put less strain on hospitals. > As at Jan 6, general practitioners now play a bigger role in deciding which Covid-19 patients require closer supervision, and which ones can safely recover at home. > The shift came amid growing evidence that the Omicron variant, although more transmissible, is less severe. --- 1.0.2      ',\n '>  Singaporeans to pay slightly higher polytechnic and ITE Nitec fees for 2022 academic year > SINGAPORE - Tuition fees for Singaporean polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Nitec students will increase slightly for the 2022 incoming batch, according to the institutions\\' websites. > Fees for two-year Higher Nitec Singaporean students remain unchanged. > This is the first rise in fees for Singaporeans studying in polytechnics since 2019, as the past two years\\' increases affected only foreign students. > All the tuition fee increases will affect only incoming students in the new academic year and not students who are already enrolled. > The polytechnic school year begins in April while ITE has two intakes - in January and April. > Singaporeans entering the five polytechnics here will pay an annual tuition fee of $3,000, up from $2,900.

Why many fathers don't take paternity leave and why experts say they should > SINGAPORE: When one father wanted to use his government-paid paternity leave for the birth of his son in November 2018, resistance from his manager made it hard for him to do so. > “When I tried to take paternity leave, there was no clear answer as to whether I could take it,” said Mr Gary Lee (not his real name), who was then working in the finance department of a multinational corporation. > Mr Lee, 35, said his female supervisor made passive-aggressive comments and pointed to the backlog of work he would accumulate if he took the two-week entitlement. > “When she (my wife) was in the labour ward, I was still doing a conference call. The next day, I was back at work and I probably only used three days of the paternity leave, taking half a day each time.” > He felt guilty and frustrated over the situation, but was thankful for the support from his wife, he said. Mr Lee has since left the firm. > “I feel that a huge part of paternity leave depends on the tone set by the management and how the managers execute it,” he said. > THE ISSUE OF WORKPLACE SUPPORT > While growing numbers of dads use the government-paid paternity leave to which they are entitled, almost half do not. > In response to queries from CNA, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the take-up rate of paternity leave was 55 per cent in 2019, according to its latest figures. Among fathers who utilised the leave, the majority used the full two weeks. > The take-up rate is an increase from the 47 per cent in 2016, a ministry spokesperson said. Since 2017, eligible fathers have been given two weeks of government-paid paternity leave. > While MSF's research across different types of jobs and companies showed that most fathers want to use their paternity leave to be more involved when their child arrives, the key reason they do not is workplace support. > “This includes whether supervisors are adequately assuring that using paternity leave will not affect fathers’ career prospects and that colleagues are willing to cover fathers’ duties in their absence,” the spokesperson said. --- 1.0.2      \",\n 'To be honest LHL is old, aging and decline happens to the best of us.

Assuming he didn\\'t, all that is going to happen is a few months more for PS to prove himself before this entire saga ends. Assuming he DID instruct RS to lie, do you know what this proves? This means that your dear leader of the opposition has violated the integrity and trust people had in him. What happened if he was in position of power? Not only would he have lied, he would shown that he is someone that is willing to twist the truth to make things easier and seem better for him. Secondly, even with the police, or in the civil court, when one is accused of something, he has to prove himself innocent, whereas the prosecutor will try to prove him guilty. Yall seem very scared that they might be able to actually find something. If he is not guilty, then they would not be able to find evidence to convict him. PS indeed has the charm a leader should have, but if they can prove that he instructed RS to lie, then how? Lastly, VB did not lie. He giving the information he ASSUMED to be true. Additionally, if he did lie, why would they come out and say \"oh, we screwed up, we did indeed use TT data for a police case sorry\". Assuming he did lie, he has now spoken the truth without as many prompts as compared to RS. he also did not accuse anyone else of instructing him to lie. Additonally here is a little analogy for you. Ah Beng, Ah Seng, and Ah Heng are 3 friends. One day, Ah Beng finds out Ah Seng has been stealing from him. Ah Seng then says \"OH AH HENG TOLD ME TO DO SO\". There is no reason to believe nor disbelieve that Ah Seng was telling the truth. Then how? You have to investigate.

They lied under oath to protect themselves, to cover up their role, and to push the blame solely on to Ms Khan, claiming that she and other witness like Ms Loh had lied to the committee. > This is indeed more serious than what Ms Khan did, if it is so. > By lying under oath, they sought to frustrate the Committee process. They displayed the same kind of misconduct that the Committee was set up to address. They betrayed the trust reposed in them as MPs – and not least Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition. This, I hope members appreciate, if true, is a very grave matter\" > So, members must decide what Parliament will now do about this. Can we pretend nothing happened? Or if that\\'s too much to stomach, given the strong evidence laid out by the Committee, perhaps we lower our standards a little: note that untruths were told, but argue that it was after all not so serious a lie, and no harm was done. > If we do either of these things, we too would become complicit in dishonouring and demeaning Parliament. We must take the transgression seriously and act on it. And I\\'m glad that\\'s a conclusion the Committee has come to and recommended to the house. > What alternative choices did the Committee have? It could have recommended to Parliament to administer a token slap on the wrist. But that would show that we were taking a very serious matter rather lightly.

This is something that Parliament has the power to do, but had the Committee recommended that, and Parliament decided on the penalty itself, the opposition would surely have cried foul and accused the PAP of using its majority to persecute the opposition.

Issues over what the data can be used for was the number one concern by the public. The very basic action required as you yourself has done was to check before commenting. Yet this seemingly basic action was supposedly not done and instead multiple ministries worked together promoting TT usage stressing to the public it will only be used for contact tracing. Also, Vivian did not come up with TT alone, The idea that noone in the ministries and departments involved checked their announcement was false is a level of incompetence that is hard to believe. >It is to no surprise no one recall offhand a very particular section of an act which he in no means would have come across given he is never the MHA minister nor a policeman in his career.

Desmond Lee was far less antagonistic and we can see that those sessions where much more amicable.',\n  'entities': {'Pritam Singh': [[PS,\n     was,\n     being,\n     \",\n     lawyered,\n     \",\n     and,\n     so,\n     as,\n     a,\n     lawyer,\n     he,\n     hit,\n     back,\n     .]],\n   'Edwin Tong': [[Edwin,\n     Tong,\n     was,\n     not,\n     really,\n     being,\n     fair,\n     and,\n     pretty,\n     antagonistic,\n     .]],\n   'Desmond Lee': [[Desmond,\n     Lee,\n     was,\n     far,\n     less,\n     antagonistic,\n     and,\n     we,\n     can,\n     see,\n     that,\n     those,\n     sessions,\n     where,\n     much,\n     more,\n     amicable,\n     .]]}},\n '49': {'comment': \"1) So let's imagine a meeting between PS and RK, where she admitted he asked her to go to the COP, so that's one time asking her to tell the truth, which is based on RK's statement, >But after discussions and me explaining the circumstances that led me to the information in the first place, that changed. if they agreed with her, why was there a need for a discussion? and if the discussion was positive, there was no need to explain the circumstances. which obviously points at resistance from WP leadership against her not coming clean. so this points at repeated attempts asking her to tell the truth. and at that point of time, based on her state of mind, from recounting her painful experiences, they may have choose not to push her further and told her she should decide on her next step and they will not judge her. And why would it not be possible for her to deem her next step to be to take it to the grave and take what WP told her as tacit approval of that step. It means both were not lying, just RK made assumptions that WP by not pushing her tacitly agreed with her taking it to the grave. This is definitely not far-fetched considering RK at times seemed to be living in her own world, and showed signs of cognitive dissonance and doing things without a care for consequences. for eg. when told to substantiate, ignored it (PS asked her to do so before she made the speech), or saying she sometimes dont know what she is doing. (she admitted to WP leadership) 2) Pritam's testimony was very consistent, he insisted from the very start he asked her to come clean repeatedly. I don't think it can be misconstrued as him being inconsistent in any way. It clearly points to the inconsistency between PS's statement and that of RK, which I have given a reasonable reenactment in point 1. I would largely discount the testimonies of her aides as they were basically giving 2nd hand accounts of what RK told them, so in actual fact they are an extension of what RK said, or what one would call tiagong from RK. when the aides claimed PS said he will not judge her and it is her call. it is her call to come clean or her call to decide when to come clean, this is all up for interpretation. regarding SL's testimony, it is consistent with PS, and seems like the COP is cherrypicking certain soundbites to paint PS in a bad light.\",\n  'entities': {'Pritam Singh': [[to, paint, PS, in, a, bad, light]],\n   'Raeesah Khan': [[from, RK]],\n   \"Workers' Party\": [[to, WP, leadership]],\n   'Sylvia Lim': [[regarding, SL, 's, testimony]]}}}"

Some other examples: look at unions going ooh outrage over \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Jamus\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n' 'folk wisdom' comment, NiceGuy Heng Swee Keat and Tan Chuan Jin going super saiyan and overly personal with uncle \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Leong Mun Wai\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n, government and \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #7aecec; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    PAP\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ORG</span>\n</mark>\n virtue signalling about how much they care about muh women and the environment. Events all over the world and the last GE in Singapore show that, increasingly, people aren't won over by sound reason and logic. Bread and butter issues are taking a backseat. To win in politics today, you need to virtue signal, put up a good show and abuse the tendency for people to take sides emotively. I can't entirely blame the COP for riding on this trend. 10 years ago \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Pritam Singh\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n's attitude in the COP would have been regarded as disastrous, and contrary to the &quot;Responsible and Constructive \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #7aecec; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Opposition\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ORG</span>\n</mark>\n&quot; image Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong sought to maintain, vis a vis people like CSJ and JBJ. In this COP however, \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Pritam\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n emerged as both a hero and victim, 2 contradictory but nevertheless very compelling archetypes that wins people over easily. All he had to do to appear as a hero GigaChad was to give some defiant retort for 30 seconds, so that some punk can clip it and put it up on TikTok or WakeUpSingapore. All he had to do to appear as a victim was to answer questions off-tangeant to force the COP to interupt him mid-sentence to remind him to stick to the question. He must have seen how the public reacted to Thum Ping Tjin's hearing, which he personally sat on 4 years ago In many people's eyes, including mine and the \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #7aecec; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    PAP\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ORG</span>\n</mark>\n, \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Pritam\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n and the \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #7aecec; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    WP\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ORG</span>\n</mark>\n were not at their best wrt Raessah Khan before and during the COP.
